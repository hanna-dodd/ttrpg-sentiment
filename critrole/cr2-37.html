<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">Hello, New York! [cheering] Wow! I would ask how everyone's doing, but I can already tell. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">[cheering] Who's ready to get turnt up tonight? [cheering] You know, I talked to Taliesin a couple weeks ago and I said, "How in the world do we top what you did for me for Gen Con?" He said, "I have five words for you, Brian. The Goth of Wall Street." [laughter and cheering] Well, we have a great show planned for you guys. I am really interested to see how this is going to go. Given the last few episodes, I'm sure you are. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">I have a couple of bad cop announcements, it's what I get paid to do. Up first, and you know, we're all really waiting to see what Sam's going to do, am I right? [cheering] (sighs) Hide your kids, hide your wives. First of all, feel free to engage along with the show tonight. Some of the ways you can engage along with the show is clapping, which you seem to do very well, wonderful. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">[applause] You can definitely cheer. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">[cheering] This one's going to be hard, you can cry. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">[fake crying] That sounds good. Sounds genuine. The one thing that we do ask that you refrain from during the live shows is shouting out any rules, suggestions, things like that. "Use Feather Fall!" Shit like that's not going to fly. "You have two spell slots left!" Nobody cares what you have to say. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">Especially no jokes that you think are going to either get a reaction from the cast or from the rest of the audience. Take it from someone who knows, sometimes you think you have a great joke and it's a fucking terrible one. At Gen Con this year, some people decided to rebel against the rules and nothing made me happier than hearing someone yell out a joke and it bombing. I was up in the balcony leaning down going, "Welcome to my Tuesday night, every week." I guarantee you guys Matt and the cast are going to put on a fantastic show for you tonight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">[cheering] Yep. Despite the fact it will not contain any of your bad jokes. Up next: we will be broadcasting at an hour delay tonight, so there is an extremely strict no spoiler policy in the house tonight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">After Sam comes out and sits down, there's really no need for you guys to have your phones out tonight. Please do not spoil it for all of our Critters watching literally around the world. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">Don't get on Twitter, don't get on Tumblr, don't get into Twitch chat and say shit, don't be a dick. Please, please, please. Ultimately, there's more of them than there are of us, so we got to be careful, if you know what I'm saying. I don't want people coming after us. Okay, if you're at New York Comic Con this weekend, please check out our schedule at CritRole.com. We're going to be busy. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">How many people are going to Comic Con? [cheering] Wow. That's going to be awesome. Let's see. Oh yeah, introduce the cast, okay. Without further ado, I would like to introduce the cast of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:09:53" id="l0h9m53s">Our amazing friends at Wyrmwood have been so kind to help facilitate this for all of you amazing Critters out there. On your way out tonight, make sure you grab it, don't forget it, you'll regret it. Whew. Man, my heart is going (quick pounding). Never get used to this. A quick little thing before we get started on the game. We mentioned it earlier this year, we have our fantastic continuation of the Vox Machina: Origins comic book with Dark Horse that we're in development on. The next six issues are currently-- we're in the process of getting them going. Currently, the planned date is the summer of next year. We're happy to announce that our original artist, Olivia Samson, a fellow Critter from the community, who's done an amazing job, is returning to be the artist for this. We're going to reveal a couple little art pieces here to show you some of the new characters you'll meet next summer, including our very own Pike and Percy. If you want to give a quick view of that up there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h9m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:11:16" id="l0h11m16s">Some of these characters you may have seen in our pre-stream recap video from years ago. You also get to see-- I think some of these cast hasn't seen them until tonight now. We've got Abjurist Noja, we've got Wilhand Trickfoot up there, we got Pike when her hair was still dark, before her first death. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h11m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:11:36" id="l0h11m36s">We have casual prison Percival in his true Whitestone, pale-ass self. We got Drez Vina, we got a temple keeper who was working for Lady Kima in Westruun. We have Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien, who you saw a few times throughout the first campaign, as well as Nala the dryad, who you got to meet-- the nymph that you got to meet later in the campaign. You get to see her first interaction with Grog. A couple other fun characters that you'll get to see throughout the story. Anyway, really excited about that. More information will become available as it does, but hopefully you guys get to enjoy it next year. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h11m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:17:44" id="l0h17m44s">Perfect, there we go. Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein, in following a thread of information that may tie into some aspect of Fjord's curious history after he chest-vored a sphere, discovered that, apparently, a group of individuals were hired to retrieve this and bring it to a Captain Avantika. Upon following this thread, you found your way to the city of Nicodranas on the Menagerie Coast, outside the Dwendalian Empire. You met up with Yasha once more, you happened to take care of a man who was bothering Jester's mother. Very thoroughly. Upon coming upon this character, Marius LePual, who you've been following, you got into an altercation at the docks and accidentally took their boat. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h17m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:17:44" id="l0h17m44s">However, you managed to sneak your way back to Nicodranas the following day before it seemed there was much of an uproar searching for you. You stealth hired a crew, including bringing Orly the tortle bard on as your navigator, and made your way out to sea towards this island called Urukaxl that you believed may have been the one, based on this piece of a map that you had recovered within the ship, The Mist. You changed the name of the ship to The Mistake. You became Captain Tusktooth, was it? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h17m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The other boat, however, seems to carry two figures, one looks to be a female, a little older, maybe in 50s or 60s, the other figure seems to be the one that's rowing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h24m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Eventually emerging, the first thing you see is one giant meaty hand come over the top of the side of the ship, and rising up, you see a haggard female ogre. You see stringy, greasy hair that's peeling in front of the face, obscuring part of one eye, the other one looks to be a bit clouded. You can see these like streaks of dark, what would've been possibly makeup, and beyond that, a leather tunic and these thick, rippling, muscular arms. She eventually gets over the side of the ship and then puts her hand over and helps the other two up. One of them appears to be a gentleman, probably in his late 30s, mostly bald, a little bit of hair on the sides, a light blond, and he seems to be a little more demure compared to the two. Immediately his gait and presence seems to be more of at least a lower position on the hierarchy of the other ship. The last one that comes up is the woman that you saw. This woman, she's a tougher-looking middle-aged woman, thicker, heftier body, weathered face. She's wearing tattered robes, but beneath that there is a set of leather armor, there is a cutlass to one side, and she has this small amulet that's dangling from a heavy chain around the neck. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2IYaW9lUM4&t=0h26m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Immediately, your attention is grabbed by the central figure, a female elf, with light brown skin, with red, wild hair that falls in clustered strings around her face and down the back. You see she's wearing a long, sleeveless gray coat with a high collar that bends at the edge of the shoulders, with a thick scarf around her neck. You see she has heavy elbow-length gloves and knee-high boots that look weathered with use and probably brutality. They are stained in places where that could only have been acquired by meeting the face of somebody else.
