3,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play the first game of our new campaign of Dungeons and Dragons. "
4,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,(cheering) 
5,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Super excited to be back. I've missed this a lot. Missed this-- oh, you guys will be fine. So yes. Glad you guys can join us, apparently in some crazy numbers. So welcome new viewers. Hope you enjoy your stay. So, without further ado, let's get this going so we can get through our announcements. Since it is our first episode of the year, of the campaign, I want to make sure that we get our announcements out of the way. "
6,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"We've got some cool stuff to talk about. First and foremost, we have two sponsors tonight. Our first sponsor-- and we're going into, for a time, a cool partnership with the folks at DnD Beyond, actually. They've been really awesome, and we've been talking, and anybody who hasn't seen it, it's an online digital tool where you can create your own D&D character, they have options to purchase any of the current D&D books out there, and then carry over any of the character options and racial options over into it, so you can basically use it as a tool. We'll be using it to help us out in the game as we go, 'cause it's actually got some pretty cool stuff. So excited about that. It is D-N-D Beyond, by the way, if you haven't seen, not the ampersand. It's D-N-D. "
7,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,As in nnnn. 
8,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Nnnn. But yeah, so they're going to be a long-term partner for the show, so working with us through the start of this campaign. We're super excited. But yeah. So we're excited. You can currently activate-- it should be now-- some Critical Role content on there. They should have available the Blood Hunter class that I created a couple of years ago, kind of refining. Should be available for you guys to find on the DnD Beyond, which I'm excited about, and there's a one-time discount of $10 off any digital book in the dndbeyond.com marketplace if you use the codeword 'beginnings' in there right now. So yeah, get a chance to check it out. "
9,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,(vomiting noises) Would you like some? 
10,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"So yeah. I'm super excited to have that, guys. So you apply that code at checkout to make that happen, in case you're confused and trying to get it to work. There's a bunch of stuff to explore on there, and a bunch of cool ways to incorporate the existing breadth of D&D lore and options in there, and now you have some of our stuff in there as well, and hopefully more Critical Role content and Tal'Dorei content and Exandria content down the road to also be available on there as we go. Super excited about that. I'd like to thank you guys at DnD Beyond for being awesome. We also have our second sponsor. Sam, if you want to take it away. "
11,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,I'm our second sponsor. 
12,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
13,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Thanks, Sam! "
14,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"No. Welcome, new viewers. Every week-- or many weeks, I am charged with writing the ad for the sponsor of that week. I did this one way back in mid-December, so it'll feel a little stale. "
15,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
16,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,Sorry. I didn't have time to write a new one. 
17,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Apologies to our sponsor. But our second sponsor tonight is Backblaze. They offer unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs. You can restore from the web or via hard drive. They'll even overnight FedEx a drive to you, and because it's Christmas season, I wrote this. 'Twas the night before Critmas when I clicked on my mouse, but the drive wasn't whirring; it had said 'Adi-ouse'. When up from the cloud there arose such a sight, I knew in a flash that my shit was all right. As I spat out my plate of cold chicken kiev, down my chimney came a weird little elf named Lev. I said, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa, how'd you get in my place?"" Lev gave me a wink and punched me in the face. And suddenly he fired up a pipe and started to restore my computer from a backup he carted. My documents, like slash fiction from My Little Pony. My photos, like me naked, covered in bologna. He mumbled that you can get backed up at once for a merry little fee of $5 a month-s. You even get 15 days free if you scroll over to backblaze.com/criticalrole. And just like that, my computer was on. Lev greased up his body, and bam, he was gone. But I heard him exclaim, ""Peace out, yo, whassup! Happy Backblaze to all, don't forget to back up!"" (cheering) "
18,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"I'll write another one for Easter, I promise. "
19,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
20,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Thank you, Sam. So thank you, Backblaze. "
21,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,Happy to have you for our sponsor tonight as well. 
22,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Also, as a heads-up, we've had our friends at Wyrmwood for a while have been awesomely providing Wyrmwood dice boxes and dice trays and dice towers to give away to people in the community. They have new boxes for all the players in the new campaign. "
23,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,And they have been working on something for a while for us to kick off the new campaign. They made us a new table. If we can go to a camera view of this table they made for the campaign. 
24,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,(cheering) 
25,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"It's made out of English brown oak, the center Critical Role inlay is made of ash burl, is the background, and then rosewood for the d20 outline, wenge for the Critical Role words themselves, and silver stringing around the border. It was built by hand in their Massachusetts office and workshop, and it was hand-rubbed oil on a wax finish. Over a hundred hours were put into this table. They did an incredible job, and we're super honored to have that here, and thank you guys for showing such an awesome appreciation for what we do. "
26,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,It smells really nice.

29,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"And, when we get canceled, this is going to be a great dining room table. "
30,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"This is true! Thank you guys, Wyrmwood. If you aren't familiar with any of their stuff, go to wyrmwoodgaming.com, that's W-Y-R-M-wood Gaming dot com. They do awesome work. It's really super high-quality, it's great. So thank you guys.

31,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Laura, do you have an update for merch stuff in the new year? "
32,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"(yells) Okay. Yes, I do. It's a new campaign, new us, new merch. I don't know which camera I'm looking at. "
33,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,That one. 
34,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"So we released our teaser on socials, and everybody was like, ""I want that as a poster!"" So we listened to you, and we made it a poster! (cheering) "
35,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,It's a real poster? 
36,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,It's a real poster! 
37,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Oh, wow! "
38,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Look at this lameness that you could have on your wall! So yeah. It's in the store right now, you guys, and we printed a small amount, so those ones will be shipped faster, and then after that it'll just be pre-order, but I think it's all listed as pre-order, so just so you know. "
39,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,Can you photoshop out my crotch region? 
40,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,No. 
41,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"That would be a lot of photoshop, man. "
42,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"None of us have that much talent in post, Sam. "
43,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,But let's just talk about this Matthew Mercer. 
44,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Let's not talk about what I-- when I put that outfit on, I did not consider quite the permeation in my life it would become. So there's that. "
45,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,So we can be with you always. Matt can stare at you while you sleep. 
46,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,That's actually how Purvon dressed. 
47,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,God damn it. 
48,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Hey, first throwback! Well done. "
49,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Oh yeah. We've got to be careful, guys, because we have a lot of people that haven't watched the last campaign, or haven't finished the last campaign, so no spoilers for last campaign. "
50,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,I don't really remember it. 
51,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Well, we all died, so. "
52,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"That's true, yeah. Okay, next announcements: the Critical Role podcast we have currently up to date. All of Vox Machina's story, the whole first campaign, is now on the podcast. You can find it where the finest podcasts are downloaded. And do we have an update as far as the release schedule for this podcast? "
53,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Yes, we do. They will be releasing one week after we are live. We'll be one week behind. "

55,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,They will be releasing on Thursdays the week after. 
56,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Oh, so you can listen to it in the morning and watch it live at night. If you have a lot of free time. Or a really long drive, maybe. "
57,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,An extra eight hours to spend every Thursday. 
58,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"To be fair, you guys would have about as much free time on a Thursday as I would.

61,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"I've read it. It's so good, it's real good, it's so good. You guys, Vox Machina's story ended at this table, but it is going to live on and on and on-- at least for three more issues. "

73,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"With the new campaign, I want to renew our appreciation for and make sure that we push to you guys that we, from the very beginning, have been supporting a really amazing charity called 826, 826LA being our local chapter. They have 826 groups all over the United States that they do after-school creative writing, and a lot of great creative classes for children who are either underprivileged or don't have opportunities to go to these types of classes. They do wonderful, wonderful work, and we've been supporting them from the very beginning, and we're just doubling down on that for this new campaign. You guys as a community have been fantastic in supporting them, and all the charities that we've supported from the very beginning. Critmas every year has been a very prime example of that, so I just wanted to continue to push that forward, share the love, and a big thank-you to 826 for being such an amazing source of creative drive for so many young kids who normally wouldn't have that opportunity. So you guys are amazing, and show them your appreciation if you can. "

76,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,(cheering) 
77,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"He actually painted me and Marisha's cake toppers for our wedding, and whenever you manage to see them in the campaign, you can know that it's his handiwork. Soon enough. "
78,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Also, fun fact about Ian Phillips: I grew up with him. He was one of my brother's best friends when we first moved out here to LA, and so when that name was floating around, I was like, wait a minute. And then we reconnected back on Instagram. It's such a crazy story. You know, Critical Role brings it all back around. "
79,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
80,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"I love it. So you can follow him, @PaintingTusk on Twitter. "

83,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"And final thank-yous to Warner Bros and Monolith Entertainment for letting us incorporate the Shadow of War soundtrack into our Critical Role soundtrack here on the air, so those will be coming into the new campaign. And, super excited, CD Projekt Red has been nice enough to allow us use of the Witcher series soundtrack to also incorporate into the campaign, which, honestly, when we started playing at home, the Witcher soundtrack was most of my music, and I couldn't use it when we started streaming, and so it's been a cool full-circle to be able to bring it back in. "
84,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Plus it brings a unique flavor that works with the new campaign setting, so. "
85,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"With that, I believe our announcements are done. "

So normally we don't do this, and I did this once before when we released our other opening title sequence. Yeah, 50th. So we're going to do this again. These are just people who do so much and who do not get enough love. I'm going to shout them out. Sean Becker, who's the unsung hero of Geek and Sundry, he's the executive producer. T.J. Rotell, he's our production manager around here, he makes sure that we actually have cameras. Maxwell James, our producer that makes this show go every week. Dani Carr, our production coordinator, also huge producer here. Steve Sprinkles, who directed that amazing opening title sequence. "
98,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,That's not a real name! 
99,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"I know. I love it on the slate. It always says 'Sprinkles'. Jan-Michael Losada, who is our D.P., and is the same D.P. from last time. Tristan Savage-Tate, our first A.C. Sean Delahunt, who is our key grip. Tyler Hart, who is our gaffer, who gaffs everything around here, he's amazing. Jenny Newman, who did the amazing wardrobe. She sourced all the wardrobe.

103,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Pre-Show,0,Out of Game,,"Because I didn't know there was going to be this many. Brandon Clark, who was our location manager. Pamela Joy, who shot all the photos for that, and Loretta Ritchert. "

116,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Recap,1,Narration,,"Welcome to Wildemount. The year is 835 P.D., or post-Divergence. This continent is divided both by jagged terrain and political powers. The Menagerie Coast, a collection of city-states united under the Clovis Concord, monopolizes the southwestern shores and ports of Wildemount, thriving on open trade and cultural freedom. "
117,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Recap,1,Narration,,"Beyond the Cyrios Mountains lies the massive region known as Wynandir, bisected by the Ashkeeper Peaks. Eastern Wynandir houses the expansive wastes and turbulent badlands of Xhorhas, overrun with all manner of beasts and terrors, relics from the final battles of the Calamity that ruined that scarred landscape. "
118,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Recap,1,Narration,,"Northward, you would find the Greying Wildlands, a lawless realm harboring a curse that has kept it unconquered by human hands. However, this story begins in the territory of Western Wynandir, within the boundaries of the Dwendalian Empire. "
119,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Recap,1,Narration,,"Emerging 13 generations before, the Dwendalian Empire has slowly spread to encompass the surrounding societies of the region, absorbing the peoples of the Zemni Fields and the Marrow Valley, before finally conquering the Julous Dominion and taking the whole of Western Wynandir for the Empire. "
120,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Recap,1,Out of Game,,There will be no test. 
121,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Recap,1,Out of Game,,No. This is-- let me continue.

123,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Recap,1,Narration,,"You live as you did before. The crown only takes a tithe of what you produce and earn. You follow its laws, worship its gods, and bow to its installed local leadership. In return, denizens of the Empire are protected from the chaotic horrors and shadowed evils that stalk the edges of the civilized lands. This accord has led to a prosperous century for the Empire, or at least the political elite. Tensions brew beneath the chafing watch of the Crown's Guard. Every temple is government-owned and run, and worship outside the approved idolatry is met with imprisonment. "
124,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,1,Narration,,"Rumors of military clashes at the eastern border near Xhorhas have many common folk on edge. Our story, however, begins much smaller. Here in the southern reaches of the Marrow Valley, beyond the entry gates of the Wuyun Gorge, lies the small rural town of Trostenwald. Bordering the blue waters of the Ustaloch, this town came to prominence near the turn of this recent century, when the surrounding fertile farmlands were discovered to produce a unique type of grain and wheat, leading to a boom of breweries. When the glut subsided, three large families stood triumphant in the local business of fermented delights. Now Trostenwald thrives on their exports of fish, crops, and ale. Here in this sleepy trade stop along the Amber Road, a handful of wandering destinies slowly begin to intersect. "
125,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,1,Narration,,"We begin in the early hours of the morning on the day of Grissen in a messy room on the second floor of the Nestled Nook Inn. A bleary-eyed, bruised man in a tattered coat slowly wakens from his lengthy sleep, catching his small, snoring ally curled at the foot of the bed. Liam, if you would like to describe your character, please. "

128,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Out of Game,,Were we supposed to prepare this? 
129,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Narration,,"I'm pretty filthy. I have a mess of reddish-brown hair, and really filthy road clothes. I wear a long coat that I slept in. I slept about 20 hours last night. Jeez. Unshaven, a bit of a mess. "
130,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Out of Game,,So far you're just talking about current Liam. 
131,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,1,Out of Game,,What color are your eyes? I need visual. 
132,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Narration,,"They're blue. That's it. It was a rough day yesterday, and-- that's it. "

134,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Narration,,Oh. Caleb. Caleb Widogast. 
135,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,1,Narration,,"All right. As your smaller friend curls awake, Sam, would you like to describe your character? "
136,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Narration,,Yeah. Um. I am a little goblin girl. 
137,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Sounds,,(laughter) 
138,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Narration,,"I am a goblin. So, you know, the green skin, the green hair, the yellow eyes. And she wears not-great clothes, just like her traveling companion there. She hides in the shadows a lot, because she knows goblins aren't welcome in this part, and that's about it. I mean, she's a little skittish, and right now she's probably stirring awake as well, right? "
139,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,1,Narration,,Well. What's your name? 
140,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Narration,,Oh. Nott the Brave. 
141,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,1,Narration,,"So Caleb, as you come to consciousness, you glance over and can see, slowly snoring and rousing at about the same time, Nott's eyes blink open, her slowly groaning face looking over towards you. "

143,,,,,SAM,Part One,1,Out of Game,,"Oh yeah, motherfuckers. It's on."
144,,,,,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"You were out for quite some time, there. Rough day, eh?"
145,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,"Not our best day, no. "
146,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"No, I mean, usually you're so good at everything, but yesterday you were just-- maybe you needed the sleep, is what you needed. "
147,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,Thank you. 
148,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"Well, don't thank me yet. I should probably tell you what happened while you were asleep. I mean, you were asleep for so long. I got bored, frankly. I was going through my pack and reorganizing. "
149,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,Has anybody seen you-- seen you seen you? 
150,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"Well, I mean, many people? I got bored. "
151,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"You've never slept that long, so I left, I went downstairs, I thought I'd do a bit of window-shopping, and you know how sometimes I get the itch, you know? "
152,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,"I do. Did you make it back here okay, at night? "
153,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"I'm here, aren't I? "
154,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,"Yeah, you are. "
155,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"Yeah, I did. But I might have been spotted by a few of the Crown's Guard. "
156,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,Did you have the mask on? 
157,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"No? No, I didn't. But they didn't catch me, so. Listen, I'm sorry, sometimes I get the urge, I've got to take something, you know? I was trying to replentish what you lost yesterday, and I failed. "
158,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,"Well, we-- (sighs)-- discussed coming to a bigger town. It's going to be a little more difficult now. You can't go-- it was easier on outskirts, it was easier in farms, but we can't do that here. "
159,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"I know, I'm sorry. Yeah. I know. You're right. Yep. I just got a little bit squiggly. "
160,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,That's all. 
161,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,"Okay. Well, I think today you should have the mask on at all times. "
162,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"Yeah, good idea, Caleb. "
163,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,"It's better when we're working together. If you need to steal something, do it with my help, all right? "
164,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. "
165,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,Back up the conversation a minute. Thank you. I would not be alive if you had not-- you saved my life. So thank you. 
166,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"Ah, no problem. "
167,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,Yesterday was really not great. 
168,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"Yeah, well, we'll do better today, right? "
169,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,Sure. Sure we will. Are you hungry? 
170,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"Yeah, I'm starving. "
171,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,1,Narration,,"At this point, you notice the gentle smell of cooked meats and promises of mediocre porridge and eggs just barely begins to creep beneath the subtle floor of your room, meet your nostrils. "
172,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,"Well, Nott, what are we going to do today? I can go down and get breakfast and bring it up here. At least-- I don't know. I mean, I'm a little wary of just splashing back into the town right away. "
173,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"Let's go down, get some food. I'll come with you, 'cause as you said, we're better together. "
174,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"And we'll take it from there. You need some books and stuff, right? "
175,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,Always. 
176,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,NOTT,"All right, well, that's on the to-do list. "
177,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,1,Dialogue,CALEB,"All right, well, let's get something to eat, then. "
178,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,1,Narration,,"All right, so you prepare yourself with your mask set over? "
179,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,1,Narration,,"Yes, yeah, so I have a half a mask that covers my goblin face, and with the hood over, kind of obscures. Maybe it's not a goblin, maybe it's a little halfling person or something. "
180,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,1,Narration,,"Which is helpful. The southern, more rural region of the Empire, especially near Felderwin, which is one of the largest tilling and farming areas of the entire Empire, has a very heavy halfling population. And so while this city is not the core of it, you'd probably see a larger 20-25% of the population here in Trostenwald is halfling. "
181,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,1,Narration,,"So you pass off pretty decently as long as you keep away from discerning, intent eyes."
182,,,,,MATT,Part One,2,Narration,,"So the two of you manage to gather your things for the time being, wander down the stairs from the top floor down to the base of the tavern, which, the air is already bustling with townsfolk and all manner of travelers preparing to take on the day's responsibilities. Yorda, the 40-something woman barkeep with shoulder-length blonde hair and weathered skin that you previously rented your room at the inn from, frantically darts behind the bar while the red-headed barmaid rushes from table to table. It seems that the clientele is a bit more than they were expecting this morning. Yorda yells from behind the bar to the barkeep."
183,,,,,MATT,Part One,2,Dialogue,YORDA,"Adelaine, two more brats and a bit of mush at the corner table."
184,,,,,MATT,Part One,2,Narration,,She looks up.
185,,,,,MATT,Part One,2,Dialogue,ADELAINE,I'm working on it!
186,,,,,MATT,Part One,2,Narration,,And she runs over and heads back to the kitchen.
187,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,2,Narration,,"There's a faint bit of music as two slovenly-looking musicians in the corner are trying to work for tips with a small hat on the floor that it looks like nobody's thrown any coin into it. The tables are fairly busy, except for maybe two that appear to be available between the two of you guys, if you'd like to find a seat. "
188,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,2,Narration,,"Okay. Sure. Is that easy to do, find a seat? "
189,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,2,Narration,,"Yeah, you walk over to it, you sit down. "
190,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,2,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
191,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,2,Out of Game,,Is this how D&D works? 
192,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,2,Out of Game,,What do we roll for? (laughter) 
193,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,2,Narration,,"You sit down, and due to the chaos that ensues around you, it takes a little while for Adelaine, the red-headed barmaid, to come by, and she scoots by the table."
194,,,,,MATT,Part One,2,Dialogue,ADELAINE,I'm terribly sorry. What can I get you?
195,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,NOTT,"You know, meat if you have it, but if you don't, that's okay, too. Potatoes, or bacon if it's on the menu, but really anything-- "
196,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,2,Dialogue,ADELAINE,"I can get you all three, it's fine. What you want?"
197,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,CALEB,"A Trost for each of us, please. "
198,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,2,Dialogue,ADELAINE,"For breakfast? I like you. All right, two Trosts and a bunch of meats. Be right back."
199,,,,,MATT,Part One,2,Narration,,"And she rushes off, she pulls her hair back and ties it as she goes into the kitchen, getting ready for the midst of chaos. While you guys have a moment there at the table, you can hear conversation muttering around you, and you have a brief bit of privacy to discuss. "
200,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,CALEB,"Yes, I need books, that's true, but did you find drink yesterday? "
201,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,NOTT,I have a little left in my flask. 
202,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,CALEB,How much? 
203,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,NOTT,Just a couple swigs. 
204,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,CALEB,"So that's also on the to-do list, then. "
205,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,NOTT,"I mean, if you don't want me to get too jittery, yeah. "
206,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,CALEB,All right. Okay. So we'll do that first. 
207,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,2,Dialogue,NOTT,All right. 
208,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,2,Out of Game,,I love her. 
209,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,2,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
210,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,2,Narration,,"A short time passes before the two platters are rushed over and scattered across the front of your table with a clattering.

211,,,,,MATT,Part One,2,Dialogue,ADELAINE,Put something in your belly.
212,,,,,MATT,Part One,2,Narration,,Comes back and slides two Trosts to you.

There's a man and a hooded figure at a table immediately adjacent to you. The man looks rather filthy, his hair a bit unkempt, and he's trying to finish his drink.

400,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,5,Out of Game,,I didn't think we were going to meet you so soon!

He's got a tattoo that seems to be running up the side of his face, a peacock tattoo that goes off into his very ostentatious, ridiculous, overblown robes that he wears. His two swords and pouch dangling at the side of his hips. He's very broad in his dress. "
405,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,5,Out of Game,,So a literal and figurative peacock. 
406,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part One,5,Out of Game,,Oh yes.

416,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,5,Narration,,"You watch as these figures slowly move from table to table, the tiefling engaging in some distant conversation, leaving a slip of paper, walking to the next table. Gauging the atmosphere, not leaving a slip of paper, and quickly moving on, and then eventually your eyes meet what looks to be two tables with a very motley crew of individuals that are both awkwardly avoiding their own tension and currently trying to figure you out.

I don't believe I've ever seen a group of people more in need of a good time in my entire life. Mollymauk Tealeaf of the Fletching and Moondrop Traveling Carnival of Curiosities.

424,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part One,5,Dialogue,MOLLY,Ah. I'm less of a performer and more of an intermediary for these parts. I do on occasion perform. I can read fortunes--

492,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,5,Dialogue,JESTER,Will you ask the cards if I'm going to find him?

749,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,6,Mechanics,,"No, I rolled three. "
750,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,6,Dialogue,JESTER,"Okay. So the best hand you can get is three of a kind. Then, after that, it's a straight. A high straight. Then a low straight. Then it's if you get all evens, or if you get all odds, then it's two of a kind, then it's nothing, it's just high card. Okay, but now we put in a second amount, because you can up the ante, and you get one more card. "
751,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,6,Dialogue,NOTT,I'm out.

755,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,6,Dialogue,CALEB,"Because you saved my life yesterday, you may have one more silver piece. "
756,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,6,Dialogue,JESTER,"One more silver. Okay, I'll keep it low, too, because you're only doing the one. So I only put in one silver, too. "
757,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,6,Narration,,That's a four-silver pot. 
758,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,6,Mechanics,,"Yes. And now give one of your dice back, whichever one you don't want, and roll it again. "
759,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,6,Mechanics,,So you get to reroll.

761,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,6,Mechanics,,And you get to reroll one as well.

765,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,6,Dialogue,JESTER,I got three fives.

774,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,6,Dialogue,CALEB,"Nott, Nott, that's fine. That's fine. She won my two silver pieces. We'll just leave it at that. "
775,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,6,Dialogue,NOTT,I'm sorry. 
776,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,6,Dialogue,CALEB,"That's okay. She's very jumpy sometimes.

There is one sheet that pertains to somebody in the Hills Ward looking for folks to go ahead and do an extermination run near the southern portion of the Ustaloch. It looks like there's what looks to be a vole infestation. 
821,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Narration,,What the fuck is a vole? 
822,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,It's a small rat. 
823,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,Should we do it? 
824,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Dialogue,BEAU,"I mean, we have to kill Rodents of Unusual Size. "
825,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,That doesn't sound interesting to me at all. 
826,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Dialogue,FJORD,What else is there? 
827,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,"Currently, it looks like there was another sheet that looks like most has been torn off. The rest of the board is pretty empty at the moment. "
828,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Narration,,"DM, did I tear that? I can't remember. "
829,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,"You did, yes. "
830,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Narration,,Wasn't it a delivery thing? 
831,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Narration,,"That was what it was, yeah. "
832,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,It was to help move and load crates at one of the local breweries. 
833,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Narration,,Fuck that. 
834,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,We've done that. It sucked so much. 
835,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,You did that? 
836,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,"Well, by mistake. "
837,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Out of Game,,We played D&D and we moved crates for eight hours. 
838,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
839,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Dialogue,FJORD,"We did, yeah. "
840,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Out of Game,,Welcome to level two. 
841,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,"We said no to that job, thank you. "
842,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Dialogue,FJORD,We get bored pretty easily. 
843,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Dialogue,BEAU,"We did, however, then gamble with the other workers and then Jester-- yeah. Jester-- "
844,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,"Well, I lost it, but he made so much. "
845,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Dialogue,FJORD,Maybe not out loud say that. Just a thought. 
846,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Dialogue,BEAU,"Oh, that's right. We probably shouldn't. "
847,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Dialogue,BEAU,We didn't make any money. 
848,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,Do you guys want company? Do you want us to come and hang out with you today? 
849,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,"I don't know about that. That sounds risky, I don't know. "
850,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,CALEB,"Do you know something? I, shockingly, think that's not a bad idea. "
851,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,To have these weirdos with us? 
852,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,I can hear you. 
853,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,CALEB,Yesterday was a very bad day. 
854,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,"Yes. Well, I suppose if we surrounded ourselves with weirdos, then maybe it would take some of heat off of me. "
855,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,CALEB,"Well, yes. Bottom line: can you hang with the goblin? "
856,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,Bottom line-- 
857,,,,,LAURA,Part One,7,Narration,,"and I touch Nott's shoulder, and I cast Blessing of the Trickster. "

859,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Out of Game,,(laughter)

862,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Out of Game,,That would be the worst character choice ever. 
863,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
864,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Out of Game,,We will mourn her. Tschuss. 
865,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,"Okay, so there's a slight sense of warmth that emanates from under her hand, and for a moment, you look over and glance instinctively, ready to almost draw your sword again. But it seems to quicken your reflexes. You have this surge of adrenaline that doesn't quite fade. "
866,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Mechanics,,You have advantage on all your stealth checks. 
867,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Mechanics,,For the next hour. 
868,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,Thank you. That's very nice.

870,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,Because she is all kinds of trouble. 
871,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,No one is after me! 
872,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Mechanics,,Can I make an insight check? 
873,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Mechanics,,You may. 
874,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Mechanics,,(laughter) 
875,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Mechanics,,13
876,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Mechanics,,13. If you want to go ahead and try and lie. 
877,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Mechanics,,"That's a 14, except negative three to performance. "
878,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part One,7,Out of Game,,I've been waiting for this for so long. 
879,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Mechanics,,So 11. 
880,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Mechanics,,"So, are you lying? "
881,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Narration,,I am lying. I am definitely on the run from someone. 
882,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Narration,,Good to know. 
883,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Dialogue,BEAU,So. Mask. I'm just fascinated by the mask. Looks well-made. Did you make it? 
884,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Narration,,That's a good fucking question. Did I make it? (laughter) 
885,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Narration,,I don't make things. 
886,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,"No, I presume-- and we discussed this a little bit-- we presume it may have been scavenged from a porcelain doll. "
887,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Narration,,"Oh, that's cool. Cool and gross, cool and gross. "
888,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Out of Game,,What's her name? The creepy doll? 
889,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Out of Game,,Annabelle. 
890,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Out of Game,,(laughter)

892,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Out of Game,,Too late. 
893,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Out of Game,,The internet's running with that now. 
894,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Out of Game,,Check your Twitter. 
895,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Dialogue,FJORD,It seems we have all day. What were your plans? 
896,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,CALEB,"Not much. We were going to sample the different Trosts, and I wanted to maybe do some book browsing. Nothing major. "
897,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,What's a Trost? 
898,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Dialogue,BEAU,Brewery tour! 
899,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,It's ale. 
900,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,We just can't go by the Baumbauch ale. 
901,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,What happened with the Baumbauchs? 
902,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,CALEB,"There are two others to choose from, here. "
903,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Dialogue,BEAU,"They're who we loaded crates for, and then we kind of swindled their employee. "
904,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Dialogue,FJORD,Didn't leave on the best of terms. 
905,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Narration,,"DM, which one is the one that everybody knows has got the blessing of Fryda Langer? "
906,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,"No, that is actually the Baumbauch. "
907,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Narration,,Shit. 
908,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,"Yeah, the Starosta is kind of tied with the Baumbauch family. "
909,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part One,7,Out of Game,,We're imaginary beer snobs now. 
910,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Narration,,Is that the one you need? 
911,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,CALEB,"No, I'm just saying the one that you swindled, it's got the blessing of the big cheese here. "
912,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,Oh. Well. Why do you need it? 
913,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,CALEB,"We don't need it. It's just pleasurable to have a Trost, is what they say. She kind of needs it. "
914,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,I need it a little bit. 
915,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,You need a beer? 
916,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Dialogue,NOTT,"Well, I prefer the harder stuff, but I'll take what I can get at this point. "

919,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Out of Game,,Laryngitis every Friday. 
920,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
921,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Dialogue,BEAU,"So beer tour, then circus? "
922,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Dialogue,JESTER,"I've got to say, I miss those two people we ran into at the carnival. "
923,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part One,7,Dialogue,FJORD,"I might just wait for the carnival, actually. "
924,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Narration,,"Well, if we just montage through a beer tour, we'll quickly get to the circus. To the carnival! "
925,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,You can totally do that. 
926,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Mechanics,,Can we just bring my book-browsing down to a single roll to see if anything of use-- 
927,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,"Yeah, we can do that. We'll say, if you guys decide to go ahead and travel, the five of you, you make your way through the town for the day, you coast around the Husseldorf family brewery, you meet Voss and June, who are the two very nice ladies who run the facility. The Husseldorf family. You avoid the Baumbauch, but can acquire Baumbauch ale from other taverns in the town, of course. And the von Brandt family brewery. All of them, as soon as you say 'Trost', they correct you and say the family name. They're very intent on getting rid of the name 'Trost' as an overall, discussion of Trost-brand brews, and trying to make it their family name. There's an offense, to the point where you're like, ""Oh, Jesus. I didn't realize."" "
928,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part One,7,Out of Game,,Like Kleenex and tissue paper? All right. 
929,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,But you manage to get nice and sauced throughout the day.

932,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Narration,,I don't have very much either.

937,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,7,Narration,,you are poisoned.
938,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Mechanics,,"No, make a constitution saving throw. "
939,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,7,Mechanics,,"Well, that was crazy. 12. "
940,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Narration,,"12, okay. You get a little woozy for a while, and as the sun begins to crawl towards the distant horizon, you do not manage to allow your meal to usurp your control. "
941,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,7,Out of Game,,"Aw, it's like Ren Faire. "
942,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,7,Out of Game,,Yeah. Don't remind me. 
943,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part One,7,Out of Game,,"Good times, good times. "
944,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,8,Narration,,"So as the day comes to a close, you're fairly tipsy, you're not fully intoxicated. For your trip, you wanted to head to the Hillsbrook Parchment and Binding. "
945,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,8,Narration,,Is that where I went the last time? Except not as myself. So I'll go as myself. 
946,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,8,Mechanics,,Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation check. 
947,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,8,Mechanics,,"All right. Don't fuck me, Vax. That is-- "
948,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,8,Out of Game,,That's Vax. That's Vax's dice. 
949,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,8,Out of Game,,"Yeah, the thing about even a light German accent is that when you say ""Vex"" and ""Vax"", it's the same shit. "

951,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,8,Mechanics,,That is a 12. 
952,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,8,Narration,,"12. You take the better part of 30 minutes or so, and you find there's a lot of books on farming techniques. There's a lot of books about how to grow, care for different types of vegetation, plants, various beasts of burden. You find books on the different seasons and what's best for different types of grain and wheats. You manage to pull through and find a couple of books that deal with discussion of the Menagerie Coast that talk about what's called the Clovis Concord. "
953,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,8,Narration,,It's more of a discussion of the political structure that maintains all the city-states there.

960,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,8,Dialogue,SHEENAH,"That's where the Library of the Cobalt Soul resides. They have all the information you could hope for.

961,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,8,Dialogue,CALEB,"No, it's a fine selection. Sorry. How much for this book on hoe technique? "
962,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,8,Dialogue,SHEENAH,"Oh! Jamieson's Hoedown, yes, quite. That will be two silver pieces."

986,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,8,Out of Game,,I didn't even think about that until now. 
987,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,9,Narration,,"God damn it. All right, so as you guys have gathered at this point, the oranges and the pinks of dusk begin to peek through the quite-cloudy sky, the chilled air of the coming night sky signalling the Crown's Guard to begin lighting the hanging lanterns that line the streets of Trostenwald. A renewed energy takes the streets as the sound of a fiddle seems to creep through the night air. "
988,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,9,Out of Game,,"My god, Ashley's a master fiddler, isn't she? "

993,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,9,Out of Game,,Drums. 
994,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part One,9,Mechanics,,"By the way, DM, can I ask-- sometime in the entire day, when Nott was getting wasted, could I have spent an hour using Arcane Recovery to gain back that one spell slot I used this morning? "
995,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,9,Mechanics,,"Sure, yeah. I'll allow that. All right. "
996,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,9,Narration,,"Folks begin to prod their heads out into the open air, curious about the source of this unusual din, and you find your vision capturing a small procession of flamboyantly dressed people parading through the central road. A lanky man of some obvious elven descent leads the pack, his long, ashy-brown hair curling ever-so-slightly past his mid-back, his long coat and tails knocking around by his skipping step. Two halfling women in purple and green bodysuits dance from side to side, handing flowers to children and flyers to adults, as a bald man in a neck-frilled frock coat of bright red, his face adorned in vibrant orange makeup to look like the setting sun behind him, plays the violin that you heard earlier in an upbeat, jovial manner. A tall half-orc masculine man with a well-groomed handlebar mustache that curves out to the side, billowing white silk shirt and black trousers, follows behind with a big drum slung over his shoulder, going (drumming) along with the fiddle. The tiefling man of lavender skin that you saw earlier walks along with a grin, juggling two curved scimitars as he walks in place, almost loses one and catches it, continues to go. "
997,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,9,Narration,,"Families are beginning to gather out to see this display. The two dancers part, and then a woman of short, fiery red hair and dark skin walking between them, lifting a small candle before-- fwoosh! A giant burst, a gout of flame emerges from the front of her mouth, brightens the vicinity, and everyone collectively gasps and begins cheering and clapping as they continue the walk. There, to the back of it, you see the rather burly-looking pale woman, arms crossed, just following behind and keeping an eye like a security guard to ensure that no business gets out of hand. The gasps and the cheers begin to follow, and as the procession continues down its way, the families and civilians begin to gather and follow behind. As the last bit of the sun sets behind the mountain range, the torches glowing, the procession curves through the center of the Loch Ward to the edge of the Ustaloch itself. Through the fishing village, more folks begin to gather. "
998,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,9,Narration,,Do you all follow? 
999,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ALL,Part One,9,Narration,,Yeah. 
1000,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part One,9,Mechanics,,"And I cast Blessing of the Trickster on you again, just in case. "
1001,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part One,9,Dialogue,NOTT,Thank you. 
1002,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,9,Narration,,"People following the parade, you see faces, eager for this fresh form of entertainment. "
1003,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,9,Narration,,"Children laugh and chatter excitedly, while the Crown's Guard in their familiar bronze and vermilion uniform try to maintain order between themselves being quite curious or visibly mistrusting of these hooligans that suddenly have usurped the evening air. The procession continues towards the eastern side, out along the southern edge of this Loch Ward, to the Ustaloch's southern place, towards the new, completely constructed, large, dark blue tent. Lengthy streamers of white and silver flap with the cold winds from the top of the structure. As you guys walk, you watch as the horned tiefling you had approached earlier slowly saunters up to your side, you recognizing these individuals you had spoken with earlier. "

1021,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part One,9,Narration,,"At this point, a voice rings out behind you, you see as the carnival master Gustav glances over your shoulder and goes:"

1027,,,,,MATT,Part One,9,Narration,,"And the half-elf man bows and tips his large-- it looks almost like a top hat that gets floppy towards the top and flops forward, and he puts it back on top and begins sauntering, continuing the music, but picking up their pace to get ahead of the crowd as they draw you all slowly towards the exterior tent.

The password, if I recall, is 'beginnings'. Yeah. This one. If you're in the Twitch chat, if you want to be part of this, when you're prompted there, go ahead and enter the word 'beginnings' once. If you enter it more than once, you'll get disqualified, so be careful with that. Otherwise, it gets this spamming spree of chaos. So the word is 'beginnings'.

A few feet off to the side, you see a small crowd gathered around Mollymauk, who is sitting atop a small blanket and has cards splayed before him, a similar set that you saw Jester toying with earlier, and a farmer sits across from him, listening intently.

1150,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,10,Narration,,You find two books and a modicum of change and nothing else on him. He's actually pretty sparse as far as collectibles and keepsakes.

1164,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ALL,Part Two,10,Mechanics,,Going to the book.

1243,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,10,Dialogue,MOLLY,Such grace! Such form! Such dignity! 
1244,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,10,Out of Game,,The birds are out already.

1247,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,10,Dialogue,MOLLY,"Weirdly, being part of the show means you strangely pay more. I'm not entirely sure how that works. "

1250,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,10,Dialogue,CALEB,"No, I'm not asking. I was going to help you, but if you have it, you're good. "
1251,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,10,Dialogue,NOTT,"No, you've been spotting me all day, I'll take care of both of us. "
1252,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,10,Dialogue,YASHA,Mollymauk. That Jester's adorable. 
1253,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,10,Dialogue,MOLLY,I know. Highly entertained. 
1254,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,10,Dialogue,YASHA,I like her. 
1255,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,10,Dialogue,MOLLY,I do too. 
1256,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"So, stepping into the interior of the tent, the rocky floor filled with grass and dirt and various flattened groundscape on the outskirts of the Ustaloch, you can see a thick, heavy tarp-like material hitting the very edge where the heavy dark blue cloth hangs from the sides of the tent you're within. You can see where the seating is guided across the floor, and there, already in a very packed room, you see a few dozen townsfolk that have begun to gather in a semicircle. There is the entrance flap of the tent where you guys are walking in. As soon as you walk in, you can see a central pillar, a heavy column of wood, a tree that has been completely rounded off on all sides, held aloft to carry the top of the canopy of the tent itself. And across the way, you can see a larger flap tent that is currently closed that appears to be probably the performers' entrance. You can see above you four hanging lanterns that glow with what seems like a flicker of light, but the pattern to them is consistent, meaning it's not probably natural flame. Children and people are beginning to mash around the sides, and the space along the edges of the interior of this tent is starting to get a little cramped. "
1257,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"Where do you guide them, Yasha? "
1258,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Dialogue,YASHA,Did you guys want to sit in the front row? 
1259,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,11,Dialogue,NOTT,That's what we were told is the best seat in the house. 
1260,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Dialogue,YASHA,We want to sit in the front row. 
1261,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"So there's-- if you consider a semicircle pattern here, there's-- if you're entering, you can go front to the right, front to the left, front to the center, anywhere in between. Where would you like to be currently sitting? "
1262,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Dialogue,YASHA,Front and center? Or do you want to be on the sides? 
1263,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,11,Dialogue,JESTER,Front and center! 
1264,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Narration,,I take them to the front and center. 
1265,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"Front and center, okay. "
1266,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,11,Narration,,I'm going to keep my hand on my meager purse for the evening. 
1267,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,Okay.

1272,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,11,Dialogue,BEAU,Yeah. 
1273,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Dialogue,YASHA,I didn't mean anything by it. I just-- 
1274,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,11,Dialogue,BEAU,"No, dude. No, she's never mentioned a significant other, so, I mean. "

1276,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,11,Dialogue,BEAU,Will you hold me through the show? (laughter) 
1277,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,11,Dialogue,BEAU,"Like, cradle me? "
1278,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Dialogue,YASHA,"That's an extra charge. We do do that, though. "
1279,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,11,Dialogue,BEAU,How much? 
1280,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Dialogue,YASHA,"Well, it's an extra five gold pieces. "
1281,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,11,Dialogue,BEAU,Five gold? 
1282,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Dialogue,YASHA,These arms are worth a lot. 
1283,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,11,Dialogue,MOLLY,It's a very swaddling hug. You've never experienced anything like it.

1288,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Dialogue,YASHA,How about you just keep your money and I'll put you in a chair and I'll just watch over your weapons. 
1289,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,11,Dialogue,BEAU,Okay. 
1290,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"So she places you on the ground, as there are no chairs. "
1291,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Dialogue,YASHA,"On the ground, I mean, because there's no chairs. "

1295,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,11,Narration,,That's a good point.

1300,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"So, as the music has died down and everyone begins to crowd in and whisper to themselves, eventually it begins to quiet a bit, everyone having their seats. The familiar sound of the fiddle begins to play, and everyone quickly gets quiet, down to a hush. The music seems sourceless in the interior of the tent. Everyone begins to look around to see where it may come from. You hear points of hushed ""look""s, pointing off in different areas, and at the top of the tent, you see, seeming to stretch and fall, like a slow drop of water, the man in red you saw earlier descends from the top of the tent, but now dressed head-to-toe in a matching deep blue outfit and full makeup, to where he appears out of the canopy of the tent. He hangs from a rope by one foot, it's wrapped around and clutched as his foot catches the edge. Playing his violin ever-so-slowly as he carefully descends, and then at the last moment releases the rope and lands on his feet, continuing the music he's playing. He slowly spins as the longer-haired elf leader of the earlier parade that you saw, the one that had marked back briefly to your two new friends over here, enters the tent from the distant flaps, the performers' entrance, his head now sporting that same tall hat, flopping backwards at the apex. He extends his arms, removing the hat, and takes a deep bow as the crowd begins to clap. "
1301,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,(applause) 
1302,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"Ladies and gentlemen of Trostenwald, I am Carnival Master Gustav Fletching, and allow me to welcome you to the Fletching and Moondrop's Traveling Carnival of Curiosities. (applause) "

1304,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,You hear some children giggle as he makes eye contact. 
1305,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"grant us your imaginations this eve but a trifle bit of time, and allow us to reveal a realm of laughter, mystery, danger, and beauty. I see you've already met Desmond. "
1306,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,And he gestures towards the man in all blue who's playing the fiddle.
1307,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"He'll be part of our story tonight, so keep a wily eye for the shifting fool. But first, I tell you a tale of two sisters of the Fey."
1308,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"And as Desmond slowly leaves the tent, you see two armored guards by where he is now have entered, two of the Crown's Guard are stepping by the entrance where he walked in, watch him pass."
1309,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Dialogue,GUSTAV,Lost without form into the mazes of the underworld. 
1310,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"There, where the body would break, they found a teacher in a mystical serpent, and the gift they received was the ability to bend with this maze that captured them and slither their way back to the surface to reclaim their place in the world. "
1311,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"May I present to you Mona and Yuli, the Knot Sisters."
1312,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"As he slowly backs through the performers' entrance, the two halfling dancers you saw earlier, in the full bodysuits, emerge from behind the Carnival Master as he discreetly exits. "
1313,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"They sport serpentine makeup, scales affixed to the sides of their face and arms. Approaching the central spire, the pole that holds the tent up, one immediately leaps onto the shoulders of the other, bending her back a near-impossible amount, creating this humanoid sculpture that you see the front row cringe at the idea of the pain that would cause an average individual. But these halflings are very nimble and able to create almost a single form out of two bodies. Their rigid form becomes fluid to the eye as they move and shift to the music, the violin now sourceless once again, not seeing where this Desmond is placed, but they seem to move as it picks up speed. "
1314,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,11,Dialogue,JESTER,"(whispers) It's like the serpent we fought, you guys! "

1317,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"Suddenly, the top one folds over and slams into the ground, tumbling across the center in a wild display of physical control. The two of them begin to tangle and wrap like two battling snakes, their bodies seemingly disconnecting from the rigid halfling forms you had seen, and you swear, for a moment, becoming serpentine-like as they intertwine around the base of this pole. It's beautiful and violent at the same time. It's off-putting. And watch as they curl around the base of this pole, the lights above begin to become a dull greenish-blue, and get darker and darker, presenting this imagery of the underworld. "
1318,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"One by one, they silently tell a tale of struggle, crawling across one, then the other, one at a time, using their serpentine-like forms as an extending ladder, folding over each other as they use every muscle in their body to cling around this pole and ladder-step up like a snake. It's a very strange but alluring sight, and you can't help but notice that you forget that these are two halfling girls, and you find yourself pulled into this wordless story they tell of climbing back to their place, to the surface, towards the dark sky of lightless blue cloth. As the baubles that contain the interior light of the tent begin to glow brighter and brighter, their climbing becomes more fevered. The two of them, arm into arm, leg into leg, rolling up and swirling, until eventually at the apex they grab each other's arms around the pole before spinning downward, back-to-back, legs outward, with a rapid pace, the music coming to a full crescendo. Like a Maypole, they both curl and twirl and then tumble to the ground before the audience with a flourish, arms in the air, and the audience erupts in applause. "

The fool appears at the back entrance again, taking an ominous tune with his violin this time, his outfit no longer blue but deepset black. The hanging lights darken once again as Gustav takes the center stage."
1321,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"In a flash, beyond the ash, the gods all went and gone. The darkness came to grasp, reclaim, and suffocate the dawn."
1322,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"Suddenly, out of the darkness behind him, a burst of flame lights the room."
1323,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"But from that night, a burning light doth keep back shadows' bane. The strength to fight will set alight the morning sun again. "

1326,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"As you watch, a pair of metallic fans, alight with flame, now frame the beautiful woman of short red hair you had seen before in the procession. Gustav slinks into the darkness and vanishes as Ornna spins in hypnotic twirl, her simple dress of golds and reds almost glowing in the firelight around her, the flickering of the flames giving her the visage of a warrior-goddess battling the dark that surrounds. The frenzied fiddle of the fool picks up as she twirls the fans in her grasp, her face stoic and graceful simultaneously. The hushed awe of the audience fills the air, watching this magnificent warrior strike at the shadows, the lights above flickering brighter with each spin and dive, banishing the shadows from the room. She matches the pace of the music, drawing to a crescendo, and leaps, and barrel-turns and climaxes with her striking a powerful pose as the lights rocket to a victorious luminescence. Once again, the crowd goes crazy. "

1330,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"Gustav enters as she exits with a bow, the fans flickering out. He enters clapping at Ornna. A low drumbeat begins to beat in the distance as the fiddle grows tense once more. "
1331,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"Even as the sun would rise anew, bellowing roars will quake the lands of Xhorhas and beyond. Terrible beasts, now freed from their dark masters, scattered into our world. (roars)  "
1332,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"A terrible, guttural roar shakes the room, followed by the sounds of grinding and dragged chains. From behind the performers' flap, the half-orc, Bo, who you'd met earlier, the Breaker, and the fool, who is now still playing the fiddle, yet the bow of it continues to go on its own as he drags the other chain with his arm, wrapped around his forearm. The two of them pull something through the flap. It swells, and from beneath it is revealed an enormous creature of green scales, slimy-looking skin, and a corpulent form, large toad-like legs frame a rotund torso, and muscular arms that are manacled and pulling him in. It fights and wrestles against the taut chains as it's pulled further and further towards the center of the tent, but is held in place by the two men. It roars a second time. (roars) The front row immediately pulling back and screaming."

1342,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"And as Gustav backs away, the devil-toad struggling against the chains, a soft, faint voice begins to slowly emanate from the air-- (a voice appears in the background music) (exclamations) "

She sings with a mystifying, mature voice that pierces your hearts with joy, unexpectedly and uncontrollably. The crowd audibly gasps as one, the entrancing song of this girl bringing every person into this music. "
1344,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"The devil-toad stops struggling against the chains, seemingly caught by the sound of her voice. Its face drops into a soft smile as it slowly walks towards the base of the pole and sits. The half-orc and the fool drop the chains and back away, leaving the beast free in its rapture. "
1345,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,"Her voice almost begins to summon a chorus from the ether, magical in nature, as there are no others but her joining into this piece. Her smile is infectious, and you can't tear your eyes away. "

His arms drop and clutch his chest. Gurgles a burst of vocal pain once more, and folks nearest to him begin to lean away as he begins to shake. You glance over as the old man yells out once more, as the skin on his arms suddenly begins to tear, the bones splitting from the flesh, writhing, cracking. Dust and blood shake from his wounds as his form swells. Screams begin to ring out from the audience around him, people rising up and running for the exit. Chaos breaks into the room around you. Toya's song abruptly ends, the little girl looking down with fright in her eyes, the devil-toad glancing about worriedly, the half-orc and the fool rushing up beside him to look at the transforming man. The half-orc yells, escorting patrons to the exit, "

1351,,,,,MATT,Part Two,11,Narration,,The devil-toad glances up and leaps with a sudden gust of strength to the top and grabs the center pole of the room as it begins to almost quiver to his weight. He grabs the little girl safely under his arm and leaps back down. What are you all doing? 
1352,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,11,Mechanics,,I invoke Duplicity. 
1353,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,11,Mechanics,,You watch as her form suddenly dissipates into multiple seemingly copies of her form as Jester. 
1354,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,11,Dialogue,FJORD,Yasha? We're going to need those weapons back.

The two Crown's Guard begin to try and make their way through the panicked crowd, but the people, like a wave of chaos, are keeping them at bay. I need everyone to roll initiative. "

1373,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,Probably. But then the third campaign begins.

1389,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"So 13 and then ten and ten? Sorry, 12. So Yasha got 13, then we have Fjord. And then 11. And then we have Nott at ten. And what'd you get? "
1390,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Five. Rolled terribly. 
1391,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"There we go. Okay, so. Top of the round, as this creature turns and glares about in the area, this swollen form over here to the side, that's what remains of the old man who had stood up in the center of the chamber. Jester, you're up first. "
1392,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay. Well, I'm just going to go for it, all right? I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt on the monster that just appeared. "
1393,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay, as it turns towards you. It's a saving throw, correct? "
1394,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Let's find out. You make a ranged spell attack. 
1395,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Go ahead and roll on that. 
1396,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay, okay. "
1397,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Magic, you're using magic. "
1398,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Well, it's cocked. It was 20 and then it rolled. "
1399,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,You said cocked. 
1400,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,You're a cock. 
1401,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"That's 11 plus-- what do I add to my-- Guiding Bolt, plus five. So 16. "

1403,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Yay. 4d6. 
1404,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yasha, you're almost on deck. "
1405,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Ten, 16, 18, and then any attacks in the future-- the next attack has advantage. "
1406,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"How much damage was that? 2d6, 18? "
1407,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"4d6, you said. "
1408,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yeah, it was 4d6 radiant damage. So yeah, it was 18. And then I'm going to run the opposite direction away from him, but I'm going to keep my duplicate up there. "
1409,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay, which, for your duplicate, I should go ahead and grab something. "
1410,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"Oh, you've got toys. "
1411,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,That backpack's almost as big as my dice bag. 
1412,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Almost. I was like, that's right, you can do this, so I need to pull out-- we'll say for the purposes of this, you're-- we'll put you-- this will be your duplicate, wherever you want to move it from where you are, so she moves there. "
1413,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"So she's going to stay here. I can't reach that far, but. Oh, shit, sorry. "
1414,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Just let me know where. There? 
1415,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"Sorry, I didn't realize it was-- "
1416,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,You can get there. 
1417,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay, sounds good. "
1418,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Okay, so that ends your turn. At the top of your turn, this creature closest to one of the people nearby screaming, this young woman who's trying to back away, it just turns toward her and grabs and tries to tear into her with two strikes. "
1419,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"The first one, that is actually going to miss. She ducks out of the way and begins crawling across the ground as it goes for a second attack. That, however, does hit, it's a 16. That'll do it. So with eight points of bludgeoning damage, it reaches down and slams its fist into her chest, and as it does, she gives out this horrible yelp as it rips into her and begins gnawing into her flesh and pulls away with a mouthful of it and stands up, its eyes scanning the room for the next possible victim. It's going to begin to stalk forward, coming up to that guy. All right, Yasha, your turn. "
1420,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,12,Narration,,Okay. How close am I to them-- I want to give them their weapons. 
1421,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"You're right there. You'd have to-- You're pretty close to everybody. You could distribute-- you could use your action to toss the weapons out to everybody this turn, I'll say. "
1422,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Okay. I'll pass my weapons out this turn. 
1423,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Okay, so you'll spend your action throwing them out to the individuals. So your shortsword and crossbow clatter to the ground, and you quickly scramble to grab them. Caleb's dagger falls at his foot. Your staff gets tossed quickly from behind you. Your falchion meets your arm. "
1424,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,Falchion. 
1425,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"All right. That ends Yasha's turn. Fjord, you're up. "
1426,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Can I run up with the falchion within melee? 
1427,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"You actually rush through Jester's form. You watch the image dissipate as you charge through it and meet up, face-to-face, with this large, gnarled, horrible-looking creature. What are you doing? "
1428,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Ripping the falchion, can I swing it into the creature? "
1429,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,You may. 
1430,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,And you get advantage. 
1431,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"I do? Thank god, because that was a one. "
1432,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,18
1433,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
1434,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Nice. 
1435,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,It's a real fight! 
1436,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,Yeah. 
1437,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,11
1438,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"We've got like a dozen hit points, we'll be okay. "
1439,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"All righty. That ends your turn? All right, you're done. That brings us to Caleb. "
1440,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,I would like to use my movement to push as far into the crowd as I can. 
1441,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay, going through the crowd is-- "
1442,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Half-movement? That's fine, sure. I just want people in front of me. "
1443,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Push through to about there. You end up pushing a kid out of the way. 
1444,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"That's great. That's exactly fine with me and I will pull out the diamond and cast Chromatic Orb, and I will send a ball of cold at the creature that Fee-ord-- Fjord-- "
1445,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"All right, go ahead and make a spell attack. "
1446,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yes, here it comes. "
1447,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,Watch out for Fee-ord. 
1448,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
1449,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,My goodness. That is a 17. 
1450,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,17 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
1451,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Isn't Chromatic Orb like a really strong spell? 
1452,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,No. 
1453,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,There's Prismatic Spray. Chromatic is the starter version. 
1454,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That is nine. 
1455,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ALL,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,Nein! 
1456,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"(German accent) All right, very well done, Caleb. "
1457,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,(thicker German accent) Now is the part where we dance. 
1458,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"So as you push the child out of the way, turn, putting your pocketed diamond out in front of you, you focus and you watch as this beam of light blue energy streaks past, just barely coasting between a few heads. It slams into this creature, as crystals form where the wound and impact was. It cracks back into place where it was. End of your turn? All right. Nott, you're up. "
1459,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Okay. Having seen the beautiful dwarven-- girl, was it? Who sang and soothed a monster earlier in the show, I'm going to attempt to sing and soothe this monster. So I step forward and I open my mouth, and I sing, (singing badly) And I will always soothe you! "
1460,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,Can I shoot an arrow at Nott? 
1461,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,He's killing the memory of Scanlan. 
1462,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"I know, can't let that go. "
1463,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Make a performance check. 
1464,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Performance check. Ooh, it's really good. 18, minus three, so that's 15. "
1465,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Okay. As you're singing out this discordant sound, folks nearby are covering their ears and glancing back and looking in surprise at this strange creature giving off this-- "
1466,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Narration,,Does it die? 
1467,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"No. However, it now, after taking a few hits nearby, its red eyes-- or at least one red eye slips over to look in your direction. That's as much of an effect. "
1468,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,Fuck! (laughter) 
1469,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Do you want to move, or are you going to stay there? "
1470,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Yes, I'm going to move, and I'm going to dash behind somebody in the crowd, some weak-looking individual. "
1471,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Okay. You can get behind there. Okay. All right, that ends your turn? "
1472,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"That's our M.O., baby! "
1473,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Beau, you're up. "
1474,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Oh shit, okay. To RP my tragic one on the first fucking battle a little bit, I'll turn to everybody and go:"
1475,,,,,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Dialogue,BEAU,"Guys, no, it's part of the show. "
1476,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Dialogue,BEAU,Molly said that people die. She was just a claque. Okay. 
1477,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,And then I run and I'm going to tackle the zombie guy. Can I see if I can grapple him? 
1478,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"You can certainly, on the first attack. Go for it. Make an athletics check. "
1479,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Just straight athletics. Oh god. Do I keep that? It's not good. 
1480,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
1481,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Seven. 
1482,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"17. You attempt with your first strike, and the creature just breaks away. Its strength is far more than you imagined it would be from what was originally an elderly-looking frame. "
1483,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"I go, oh, fuck that. I don't know if that's true, and I'm going to do a flurry of blows and do two, pop-pop. That's unarmed, right? Pop-pop. "
1484,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That is correct. 
1485,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"I do two, right? "
1486,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yes, if you're using your ki point to do that, yes. "
1487,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yes, I am. So first one, it's plus six? Okay. First one is 19. No, 20. First one is 20 total, and then the second one is 15 total. "
1488,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Both hit. Roll damage for each. 
1489,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Okay. Not great. 
1490,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,What are those dice? 
1491,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"They're d4s, they're just fancy d4s. "
1492,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yeah. That is four, eight, 11 points of damage. "
1493,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Between both? Great. So after the grapple fails and it pushes you away, you go ahead and pull back and then leap, kick it in the chest and then uppercut it in the chin. "
1494,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Yeah, that's cool. "
1495,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Looks back towards you. So that would be putting you up base-to-base with it there. All righty. Ending your turn? Okay, at that point, the crowd is now screaming and begins to swell and push in this direction. These folks all begin to run back and around this way. This crowd begins to push, the guards are trying to push forward, and they can only get a little ways forward to there and there. Everyone just shifts out this direction. "
1496,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"God, somebody's going to get trampled. "
1497,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,It's really a hazard. They should have had more exits. 
1498,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"I mean, it's a fire hazard, for sure. "
1499,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Caleb and Nott, I need you both to make dexterity saving throws. "
1500,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,15
1501,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Oh, pretty good. That is 17 for me. "
1502,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"All right. You both manage to just bob and weave through the crowd to prevent being trampled and backing away from the chaos as people are pushing through. The entrance is too small for everyone to leave, and there's now a giant bottleneck that's beginning to push up as people are now screaming and trying to get out. They're crying, and the chaos is just swelling into this absolute cacophony. As soon as that finishes, the devil-toad carrying the dwarven girl, who was given a decree, exits out back with her to get her to safety. These two begin to slowly back away, seeing that things seem to be handled? And the guards making their way in are looking scared at each other, not really knowing what to make of the current chaos. At that point, you watch as the woman whose chest was torn into by this creature suddenly-- (groaning) snaps up into place."
1503,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"Oh, shit. Okay, we have to keep them from being dead. "
1504,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Top of the round. Jester, you're up. "
1505,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"Oh, god. "
1506,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,What was your initiative again? 
1507,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Ten. 
1508,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Ten, oh, shit. That's right, you're with Nott, that's what happened. So Molly, you go ahead and go for your turn as well. My apologies. "
1509,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Narration,,I'm going to yell to the back:
1510,,,,,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Dialogue,MOLLY,Open the tent wide! 
1511,,,,,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,And I'm going to pull-- how far away am I? 
1512,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,You're right there. You're in the middle of the crowd as it's swarming around you and Yasha. 
1513,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"(sighs) I'm going to run around and see if I can flank that creature, if I can move towards flanking that creature with the other two. "
1514,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"You can't really flank it, but you can get next to it. "
1515,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,All right. Can I get close enough to take a shot? 
1516,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"You can, yeah. "
1517,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,Take a shot? 
1518,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,You have guns? 
1519,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"Well, old habit. "
1520,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,(laughter) 
1521,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"As a bonus, I'm flipping it out, and I'm going to activate the first sword. "
1522,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Okay, so you watch as Molly pulls the scimitar out, and as he unsheathes it, draws it across the side of his exposed chest, causing a little bit of blood to spill out, and as it does, he pulls the blade out, and you watch as the edge, suddenly, ice crystals begin to build on the outside of the blade. "
1523,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Narration,,And I'm taking a shot at the creature. 
1524,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Narration,,Taking a shot? 
1525,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Narration,,Taking a slice. 
1526,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Narration,,Taking a stab. 
1527,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,But with bullets. 
1528,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That's 21 to hit. 
1529,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That hits. 
1530,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That's not bad. That's eight points of damage and one point of ice damage. 
1531,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay, so nine points of damage on the first strike. "
1532,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"No, that was my bonus. "
1533,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"That was your bonus, that's all you've got. "
1534,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay. So one strike, you cut across, and you watch as you cut this wide wound open, exposing the fleshy organs' interior, but they're frozen where the wound cut through, and it's still holding it together. It's looking like it's starting to hurt a bit and fall apart slightly. "
1535,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Narration,,This is the bigger monster? 
1536,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,So it's the one I'm fighting? 
1537,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yes. So that ends your turn, Molly? Brings us to the top. So Jester, sorry, back to you. "
1538,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Oh, now I'm worried. I'm worried about the undead. I don't know. Well, I don't think I would know this, so it's okay. I'm going to say to the air and say:"
1539,,,,,LAURA,Part Two,12,Dialogue,JESTER,"Dude, are you here, because this is like the coolest shit we've ever seen! "
1540,,,,,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,And then I'm going to cast Toll the Dead on the first zombie creature guy. And there's a bell that tolls. 
1541,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Toll the Dead. 
1542,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"Oh, that's fucking rad, dude. "
1543,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,He has to make a wisdom saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage. 
1544,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Natural one. Go ahead and roll a d12. 
1545,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Oh, three. That's lame. "
1546,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Three points of necrotic damage. So as this deep temple bell rings out in the air above, you watch as this creature who has turned and is beginning to just whale upon the surrounding allies that are curling at its sides, it seems to retract from the sound and cover its ears briefly before angrily lashing out. "
1547,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Narration,,"And I made that sound like it was coming from my duplicate, and my duplicate's going to run back a little bit and stand next to the pole. "
1548,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Narration,,Yeah. 
1549,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Cool. Is that your turn? All right. The standing creature that's now been sliced, bludgeoned, and wounded by all three of you, is going to go ahead and make two strikes at-- roll randomly to see who it goes for. That's going to be at Beauregard. It swings at you twice, both with its giant massive clawed fists, just striking out towards you. First one is 17 to hit? "
1550,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,My armor class is 17. 
1551,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Nine points of bludgeoning damage as the first one just slams you in the chest. You feel the wind knocked out of you for a brief second. 
1552,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,The second swing's going to come at you. That's going to be a 20 to hit. 
1553,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yup, yup, that hits. "
1554,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,This thing's swinging hard. Holy shit. 
1555,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,And that's going to be six points of bludgeoning damage to you. 
1556,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"What are you at, girl? "
1557,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Don't worry about it. I'm bad. 
1558,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"It slams into you once with the fist, and the other one grabs into your stomach, abdomen region, and the claws dig in, and its jaw unhinges and drops like a snake's. "
1559,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,I turn to Fjord and I go:
1560,,,,,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Dialogue,BEAU,"I'm not a claque, this show's bullshit. "
1561,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"The other one is going to rush over towards you, Mollymauk, as you're the closest one to it, and is going to take one swing at you. "
1562,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yeah, no. I'm going to use Blood Maladict. "
1563,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay, so you're using a reaction? You don't have to roll anything for it. He just has disadvantage on the strike. "
1564,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Oh, that's right, because I'm not doubling it up. "
1565,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"That'll do it. He rolled a 16 and then a four. So as it swings towards you, you watch as suddenly the reddish burning eyes of the second creature go black, and it goes way too wide and misses you. You easily duck out of the way of its first strike. As it runs past, towards you this way, you get an attack of opportunity as it leaves your attack range to attempt to swing around Molly for a second strike. Go for it. "
1566,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That is 16. 
1567,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage. 
1568,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Nice. That is 12 points of damage. 
1569,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"With this brief opening as it rushes past Mollymauk, after its eyes go black, you watch as it stumbles, its vision ruined. With that moment, you swing out with your-- falchion, thank you. "
1570,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Yeah, it's falchion, that's right-- and strike across the back of its shoulder. You see what once was this beautiful young woman is now this swollen, horrible undead form lumbering past, and you cut a heavy chunk of meat off of its shoulder. "
1571,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"It curves around and makes a second strike at you, Mollymauk. This one without advantage. That's a natural 19. Yeah, that's a 24 to hit. All right. "
1572,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"You take eight points of bludgeoning damage, as the first one, you manage to move out of the way, and as you spin your scimitar around, you glance over just in time to have it clock you right across the jaw. Your vision blurs and doubles for a second. That's going to end their turn. Yasha, you're up. "
1573,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"All right, Yasha! "
1574,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Can I get to the big beast? Beast number one? Okay, so this is the first time I've done this, so hopefully I won't do this wrong. "
1575,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,I would like to rage. 
1576,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,(cheering)

1579,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yeah, you can reckless attack any of your attacks. "
1580,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Is that something you can do right away? That sounds like a later thing. 
1581,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Is that something you do later? Okay. I didn't get a practice shot at this. Okay. So I just roll. 
1582,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,You roll at advantage. 
1583,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,I don't know how to play D&D anymore! I just forgot how to do it. 
1584,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay, but roll again, you have advantage. "
1585,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Oh, reckless. Okay. 17? "
1586,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
1587,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,12,Narration,,I take out my beautiful greatsword. 
1588,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Freshly purchased. In fact, this is the first time it's seen battle. "

1597,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Yeah, no, it does not make the save-- it rolled-- yeah. So as you come down with your blade and carve through its body, you watch as it curls back, trying to reform and hold itself, but your blow was too strong, and its zombie-ish form cannot maintain a cohesive hold on its form, and you watch as it just crumbles to the ground, no longer moving.

1605,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"All right. That ends your turn, Yasha. "
1606,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Fjord, you're up. "
1607,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Shit. I'll turn and head towards other tree-zombie fuck. I would like to use my bonus action to cast Hex on it. 
1608,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay. So you watch as Fjord lumbers towards it, his large, armored half-orc form holding the blade in his hand. Puts his hand out, and the shadows suddenly swirl and gather around this zombified woman's form and cling to it, like it's holding it in place. So with it now hexed, what would you like to do? "
1609,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,I would like to use my falchion to open it the fuck up.

1612,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
1613,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"That's 12 points of damage, plus five points of necrotic damage. "
1614,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,17 points of damage. 
1615,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Level two, that's major. "
1616,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"So, as you rush up, after the shadows gather around it, it looks up to you, and it pulls back, ready to strike, and you just shake your head, and one large swipe of your falchion carves this giant mark across its chest. Where the cloth and flesh opens, you can see this blackened interior, where the muscles are trying to move, almost like worms, to regather and tighen. All right, that ends your turn. That brings us to Caleb. "
1617,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"All right, I know that it's restricted movement, but I will push this way through the crowd so that I have a clearer shot, as far as I can, and then I will re-up with Chromatic Orb. "
1618,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,You can push right about there. You just barely pull through the crowd to the front to get a clear-- 
1619,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Dialogue,JESTER,"Hi, Caleb. "
1620,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"I certainly don't want to do that. I want to stay in the crowd, behind people, and I will do Chromatic Orb again, but this time, I'm going to set it to acid, so see if it hit. Oh, that's not good, it's 11. "
1621,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"11 unfortunately does not hit. So as you pull it out a second time, you're pushing through the crowd and you pull up your diamond, and right as you're about to release the spell, one of the people in the crowd slams into you with her shoulder and you get jarred off to the side. The acid bolt of the Chromatic Orb flies off and actually burns a hole through the distant tent and then vanishes into the night sky. "
1622,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Narration,,Hope that didn't hit anyone. 
1623,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"All right, that ends your turn, Caleb. Nott, you're up. "
1624,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Do I have eyes on the biggie? Is Fjord right next to her? 
1625,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Fjord and Mollymauk are both next to it, yes. "
1626,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"All right. I'm going to peek out behind whatever patron I'm next to, take out my little crossbow and just shoot a little shot. "
1627,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"All right, go for it. "
1628,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,Is it made of piano wire? (laughter) 
1629,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,16
1630,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,16 hits. 
1631,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,I like how every time you roll it comes out. 
1632,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"It does. This is very bouncy. Okay, so 1d6, that's a four, plus four is eight, plus I get sneak attack damage, 'cause I'm a rogue. Another four, so that's 12. Is the creature bigger than me? I will use Fury of the Small. "
1633,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,(cheering) 
1634,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"To inflict another two points of damage, so that's 14 points of damage. "
1635,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Okay. As you pull around the corner and release your one crossbow bolt, it hits the bottom of the chin and pokes out one of the eyes. The eye goes flying off into the distance as the bolt is now jammed outside of the socket. The creature turns, glancing your direction. It looks pretty hurt, but it's still standing. "
1636,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Narration,,Can I use the rest of my action-movement-whatever bonus to look at the patron I'm next to. Do they have any baubles or jewelry on them? 
1637,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Narration,,In this moment? 
1638,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"I'll say you can use your bonus action to just look. There's nothing you can do this turn, but next turn, you could. So make a perception check. "
1639,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Oh, it's just nine. "
1640,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Nine? It's hard to look. You see this what looks to be late-30s woman dressed in some sort of general workers' clothing with a loose apron, and she's just running and scrambling to get towards the exit. You don't see anything of worth on her, unfortunately. Sorry. All right, Nott, that ends your turn. Molly, you're up. "
1641,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"I'm still engaged with it, right? Okay, I'm going to take two swipes. "
1642,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay, so you spin around. You pull your second scimitar out, as part of the strike, one of them encased in ice crystals. So the first strike-- make sure you mark which one's which. "
1643,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Purple's the ice. That's-- the purple is 12 to hit? 
1644,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,12 just barely hits. 
1645,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Ooh. So they both hit, so that's good. "
1646,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"So that's going to be-- or all three, then, because the other one is 21 to hit. "
1647,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"That hits, yeah. "
1648,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,The first one is four points of damage. 
1649,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Four points of damage? 
1650,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"I'm sorry, the magic one is six points plus three ice, so nine points. "
1651,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Nine points of damage, all right. "
1652,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,The other one is four points of damage. 
1653,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Okay. So the first strike hits, and as the scimitar carves through, the body snaps and opens, and it snaps back into place, the torso locking back in. The second strike does how much damage? "
1654,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Four points of damage. 
1655,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Yeah. The second one hits again, and you watch as the torso spins off. It looks like only the spinal column is holding it in place, but it's managing to maintain its structure as it (snarls). "
1656,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That ends your turn. 
1657,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Dialogue,MOLLY,"Someone, anyone? Yep. "
1658,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"All right, ending Mollymauk's turn, that brings us to Beau. "
1659,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,"Beau, you got this. "
1660,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,"In response to him, I say:"
1661,,,,,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Dialogue,BEAU,I thought you said you didn't let in the sick! 
1662,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,12,Dialogue,MOLLY,Just kill it! 
1663,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,I come up and I want to do a flying Superman (impact). 
1664,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,Wham! Go for it. 
1665,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,First one. Okay. 16? 
1666,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,That'll hit. Damage. 
1667,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"I had my staff-- oh, I had my staff, but I said-- "
1668,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LIAM,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"You said Superman punch, man. "
1669,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"It's fine, it's fine. Six damage. "
1670,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Six points of damage. Natural 20. You watch as you sock it in the face and the jaw breaks and then snaps back into place. As you land, pulling it back, you can see some of the teeth are actually stuck in your fist as you pull back, they've broken off into your knuckles. "
1671,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,I go:
1672,,,,,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Dialogue,BEAU,"Oh, come on. "
1673,,,,,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"I'm going to use my other ki point to do flurry of blows again, and I'm going to try and punch him in the bridge with the remainder of his teeth. "
1674,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"Her teeth, technically, this is the woman that was killed originally. "
1675,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,Oh. I'll be like:
1676,,,,,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Dialogue,BEAU,"You were so pretty, too. "
1677,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,Go for it. Two more strikes. 
1678,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"19 and 18. Natural. And then, okay. "
1679,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,That's a really pretty dice. 
1680,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Eight, 12, 13 damage. "
1681,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Mechanics,,"Natural one, no. So the second punch, you swing wide and hit the side of the head, and the neck snaps, and it's now stuck in a sideways position. "
1682,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"As it turns, the jaw, it pulls back one of its weirdly swollen clawed hands, ready to go for that open wound in your gut, and as it does, how do you want to do this? (cheering) "
1683,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,First one! 
1684,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,SAM,Part Two,12,Out of Game,,First blood. 
1685,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,"I'll do the uppercut with the other one, and the one that has its teeth in it, I want to go right between the bridge of the nose and get the teeth right in the eyes and break the nose bridge into the brain. You know that thing? Yeah. "
1686,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"And as you do that, you slam into its face. "
1687,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"You watch as the skull caves in, the teeth piercing both of the red, bulging eyes. And with this horrible sucking, sighing sound, it falls onto its back, no longer moving, the shadows released. "
1688,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,12,Narration,,I grab my gash and fucked-up ribs and immediately turn over me. Can I do a perception check or an insight check on any of the ringleaders? On any of what was going on? The ringleader or the jester? 
1689,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,12,Narration,,"That was your turn, unfortunately. That's your turn. At this point, the current threats are down, and the crowd is screaming and rushing. The two members of the Crown's Guard are rushed to the front, weapons ready, and they see both of these creatures bloodied and ruined across the base of this. In the midst of the chaos, one of them points and goes:"
1690,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,FLYNN,"You, you! Stay where you are! "
1691,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,"And you watch as the rest of the crowd slowly pushes through, you see as Gustav manages to make his way in. "
1692,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"Dear god, what's happened here? "
1693,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,"Looks over toward Bo the Breaker, the half-orc who's now joined the rest of you. "
1694,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,BO,"Sir, I don't know how he got in here."
1695,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,"And everyone looks around back at you. Bo looks at you, Gustav looks to you, Molly."
1696,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,GUSTAV,What happened?
1697,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,13,Dialogue,MOLLY,One of them turned. I don't know what happened. 
1698,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Dialogue,JESTER,There was a sick guy! There was an old sick guy and he turned into a zombie! 
1699,,,,,LAURA,Part Two,13,Narration,,And I run over and I cast Cure Wounds on Beau. 
1700,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,13,Dialogue,BEAU,"Oh, thank you, man. I'm really down. "
1701,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Dialogue,JESTER,Are you sick too? Did you get hurt? Hold on two seconds. I'm going to cure her and then I'll cure you too. 
1702,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,13,Dialogue,FJORD,"Yasha, have you ever seen anything like this happen before? "
1703,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,13,Dialogue,YASHA,No. Never. 
1704,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Mechanics,,"Seven points, that's all I could cure. "
1705,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,13,Mechanics,,That's amazing. That's great. 
1706,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,13,Narration,,I'm going to drop my sword. 
1707,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Mechanics,,"Oh, that's better for you, ten for you. "
1708,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,"Okay. At this point, the two Crown's Guard that are there are trying desperately to maintain control. You can see they're visibly shaken, and they glance at each other like they're a little out of their depths at the moment. "
1709,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,FLYNN,Stay where you are. Don't go anywhere. 
1710,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,13,Dialogue,MOLLY,"Oh, wherever will I go. "
1711,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,"And he turns to the one who's in the front, looks to the other one who just made his way through, and goes, "
1712,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,FLYNN,"Sivelmen, find someone. Bring the rest of the guard. Please! "
1713,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,SIVELMEN,"Right now, sir. "
1714,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,"And he pushes his way towards the back as the rest of the crowd runs out. Now everyone in the crowd has mostly pushed out of the tent, the last few dregs pushing through. Children crying, people of Trostenwald just exiting out the flaps as they close, and you're all standing there, weapons in your hands, wondering what to do. "
1715,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,13,Narration,,What are the corpses doing now that they've fallen? 
1716,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,"They're both unmoving, ruined, torn apart. "
1717,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Mechanics,,Can I search the corpse of the woman? 
1718,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Mechanics,,"You can. As you go to move to it, both of your forms merge. The Crown's Guard goes like,"
1719,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,FLYNN,Don't move.
1720,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Dialogue,JESTER,Which one? 
1721,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,FLYNN,Both? Uh.
1722,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,He looks genuinely confused. 
1723,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Narration,,"When I'm going ""which one?"" I make my second form just dart forward and start searching the body. "
1724,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,Okay. It mimics searching a body. It's not actually you. Begins rifling imaginary things out of the pockets. 
1725,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Dialogue,JESTER,Look at all the stuff that that one's finding over there! (laughter) 
1726,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Narration,,Can he turn and look and I try to search the other guy? 
1727,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Mechanics,,Make a deception check to try and deceive him to glance over. 
1728,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Mechanics,,Not bad. 19? 
1729,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,(laughs) He goes:
1730,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,FLYNN,"What, over there? "
1731,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,"Looks over as you jump over quickly and begin searching through it, and you guys watch her do this, and there's a clear line of sight. As soon as he turns back, he's going to notice her rifling through the other corpse. "
1732,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,13,Narration,,Is Gustav still in here? 
1733,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,"Gustav is now walking up, and he's hands up in the air. "
1734,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,GUSTAV,I'm terribly sorry. I-- this has never happened. I don't know what happened. What happened?! 
1735,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,13,Dialogue,MOLLY,We've never seen anything like it before. He just-- he gripped his heart and fell over and turned into that thing. 
1736,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,ASHLEY,Part Two,13,Dialogue,YASHA,It was when Toya started singing. 
1737,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,13,Dialogue,BEAU,"Yeah, what's with the dwarven girl? Why-- "
1738,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TALIESIN,Part Two,13,Dialogue,MOLLY,Nothing like this. 
1739,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,GUSTAV,"She's been singing with us for over two years, now."
1740,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MARISHA,Part Two,13,Dialogue,BEAU,How'd she come to you? She's a pretty young girl. 
1741,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,GUSTAV,She had no family and she was singing in the street for change. There was an opportunity. 
1742,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,GUSTAV,We seized it. We gave her a family she didn't have.
1743,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,TRAVIS,Part Two,13,Dialogue,FJORD,Put your hands down. 
1744,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,MATT,Part Two,13,Narration,,The Crown's Guard goes like (grunts). 
1745,,,,,MATT,Part Two,13,Dialogue,FLYNN,"It's fine, just don't move. "
1746,E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,A1,Arc 1: Come Together,LAURA,Part Two,13,Mechanics,,Did I find anything?
