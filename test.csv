Glad you guys can join us, apparently in some crazy numbers. So welcome new viewers. Hope you enjoy your stay. So, without further ado, let's get this going so we can get through our announcements.

E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,MATT,"We've got some cool stuff to talk about. First and foremost, we have two sponsors tonight. Our first sponsor-- and we're going into, for a time, a cool partnership with the folks at DnD Beyond, actually. They've been really awesome, and we've been talking, and anybody who hasn't seen it, it's an online digital tool where you can create your own D&D character, they have options to purchase any of the current D&D books out there, and then carry over any of the character options and racial options over into it, so you can basically use it as a tool. We'll be using it to help us out in the game as we go, 'cause it's actually got some pretty cool stuff. So excited about that. It is D-N-D Beyond, by the way, if you haven't seen, not the ampersand. It's D-N-D. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,LAURA,As in nnnn. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,MATT,"Nnnn. But yeah, so they're going to be a long-term partner for the show, so working with us through the start of this campaign. We're super excited. But yeah. So we're excited. You can currently activate-- it should be now-- some Critical Role content on there. They should have available the Blood Hunter class that I created a couple of years ago, kind of refining. Should be available for you guys to find on the DnD Beyond, which I'm excited about, and there's a one-time discount of $10 off any digital book in the dndbeyond.com marketplace if you use the codeword 'beginnings' in there right now. So yeah, get a chance to check it out. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,TRAVIS,(vomiting noises) Would you like some? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,MATT,"So yeah. I'm super excited to have that, guys. So you apply that code at checkout to make that happen, in case you're confused and trying to get it to work. There's a bunch of stuff to explore on there, and a bunch of cool ways to incorporate the existing breadth of D&D lore and options in there, and now you have some of our stuff in there as well, and hopefully more Critical Role content and Tal'Dorei content and Exandria content down the road to also be available on there as we go. Super excited about that. I'd like to thank you guys at DnD Beyond for being awesome. We also have our second sponsor. Sam, if you want to take it away. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,SAM,"No. Welcome, new viewers. Every week-- or many weeks, I am charged with writing the ad for the sponsor of that week. I did this one way back in mid-December, so it'll feel a little stale. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,SAM,(laughter) →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,SAM,Sorry. I didn't have time to write a new one. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,SAM,"Apologies to our sponsor. But our second sponsor tonight is Backblaze. They offer unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs. You can restore from the web or via hard drive. They'll even overnight FedEx a drive to you, and because it's Christmas season, I wrote this. 'Twas the night before Critmas when I clicked on my mouse, but the drive wasn't whirring; it had said 'Adi-ouse'. When up from the cloud there arose such a sight, I knew in a flash that my shit was all right. As I spat out my plate of cold chicken kiev, down my chimney came a weird little elf named Lev. I said, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa, how'd you get in my place?"" Lev gave me a wink and punched me in the face. And suddenly he fired up a pipe and started to restore my computer from a backup he carted. My documents, like slash fiction from My Little Pony. My photos, like me naked, covered in bologna. He mumbled that you can get backed up at once for a merry little fee of $5 a month-s. You even get 15 days free if you scroll over to backblaze.com/criticalrole. And just like that, my computer was on. Lev greased up his body, and bam, he was gone. But I heard him exclaim, ""Peace out, yo, whassup! Happy Backblaze to all, don't forget to back up!"" (cheering) →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,MATT,And they have been working on something for a while for us to kick off the new campaign. They made us a new table. If we can go to a camera view of this table they made for the campaign. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

It was built by hand in their Massachusetts office and workshop, and it was hand-rubbed oil on a wax finish. Over a hundred hours were put into this table.

E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,MATT,"With the new campaign, I want to renew our appreciation for and make sure that we push to you guys that we, from the very beginning, have been supporting a really amazing charity called 826, 826LA being our local chapter. They have 826 groups all over the United States that they do after-school creative writing, and a lot of great creative classes for children who are either underprivileged or don't have opportunities to go to these types of classes. They do wonderful, wonderful work, and we've been supporting them from the very beginning, and we're just doubling down on that for this new campaign. You guys as a community have been fantastic in supporting them, and all the charities that we've supported from the very beginning. Critmas every year has been a very prime example of that, so I just wanted to continue to push that forward, share the love, and a big thank-you to 826 for being such an amazing source of creative drive for so many young kids who normally wouldn't have that opportunity.

E1, Campaign 2 Episode 1 Curious Beginnings ,ASHLEY,"Also, fun fact about Ian Phillips: I grew up with him. He was one of my brother's best friends when we first moved out here to LA, and so when that name was floating around, I was like, wait a minute. And then we reconnected back on Instagram.

And, super excited, CD Projekt Red has been nice enough to allow us use of the Witcher series soundtrack to also incorporate into the campaign, which, honestly, when we started playing at home, the Witcher soundtrack was most of my music, and I couldn't use it when we started streaming, and so it's been a cool full-circle to be able to bring it back in. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

You follow its laws, worship its gods, and bow to its installed local leadership. In return, denizens of the Empire are protected from the chaotic horrors and shadowed evils that stalk the edges of the civilized lands. This accord has led to a prosperous century for the Empire, or at least the political elite. Tensions brew beneath the chafing watch of the Crown's Guard. Every temple is government-owned and run, and worship outside the approved idolatry is met with imprisonment. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

Here in the southern reaches of the Marrow Valley, beyond the entry gates of the Wuyun Gorge, lies the small rural town of Trostenwald. Bordering the blue waters of the Ustaloch, this town came to prominence near the turn of this recent century, when the surrounding fertile farmlands were discovered to produce a unique type of grain and wheat, leading to a boom of breweries. When the glut subsided, three large families stood triumphant in the local business of fermented delights. Now Trostenwald thrives on their exports of fish, crops, and ale. Here in this sleepy trade stop along the Amber Road, a handful of wandering destinies slowly begin to intersect. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

It seems that the clientele is a bit more than they were expecting this morning. Yorda yells from behind the bar to the barkeep, ""Adelaine, two more brats and a bit of mush at the corner table.""

Two halfling women in purple and green bodysuits dance from side to side, handing flowers to children and flyers to adults, as a bald man in a neck-frilled frock coat of bright red, his face adorned in vibrant orange makeup to look like the setting sun behind him, plays the violin that you heard earlier in an upbeat, jovial manner. A tall half-orc masculine man with a well-groomed handlebar mustache that curves out to the side, billowing white silk shirt and black trousers, follows behind with a big drum slung over his shoulder, going (drumming) along with the fiddle.

You can see where the seating is guided across the floor, and there, already in a very packed room, you see a few dozen townsfolk that have begun to gather in a semicircle. There is the entrance flap of the tent where you guys are walking in. As soon as you walk in, you can see a central pillar, a heavy column of wood, a tree that has been completely rounded off on all sides, held aloft to carry the top of the canopy of the tent itself. And across the way, you can see a larger flap tent that is currently closed that appears to be probably the performers' entrance. You can see above you four hanging lanterns that glow with what seems like a flicker of light, but the pattern to them is consistent, meaning it's not probably natural flame. Children and people are beginning to mash around the sides, and the space along the edges of the interior of this tent is starting to get a little cramped. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

You hear points of hushed ""look""s, pointing off in different areas, and at the top of the tent, you see, seeming to stretch and fall, like a slow drop of water, the man in red you saw earlier descends from the top of the tent, but now dressed head-to-toe in a matching deep blue outfit and full makeup, to where he appears out of the canopy of the tent. He hangs from a rope by one foot, it's wrapped around and clutched as his foot catches the edge. Playing his violin ever-so-slowly as he carefully descends, and then at the last moment releases the rope and lands on his feet, continuing the music he's playing. He slowly spins as the longer-haired elf leader of the earlier parade that you saw, the one that had marked back briefly to your two new friends over here, enters the tent from the distant flaps, the performers' entrance, his head now sporting that same tall hat, flopping backwards at the apex. He extends his arms, removing the hat, and takes a deep bow as the crowd begins to clap. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

But these halflings are very nimble and able to create almost a single form out of two bodies.

It's a very strange but alluring sight, and you can't help but notice that you forget that these are two halfling girls, and you find yourself pulled into this wordless story they tell of climbing back to their place, to the surface, towards the dark sky of lightless blue cloth. As the baubles that contain the interior light of the tent begin to glow brighter and brighter, their climbing becomes more fevered. The two of them, arm into arm, leg into leg, rolling up and swirling, until eventually at the apex they grab each other's arms around the pole before spinning downward, back-to-back, legs outward, with a rapid pace, the music coming to a full crescendo.

The hushed awe of the audience fills the air, watching this magnificent warrior strike at the shadows, the lights above flickering brighter with each spin and dive, banishing the shadows from the room.

The two of them pull something through the flap. It swells, and from beneath it is revealed an enormous creature of green scales, slimy-looking skin, and a corpulent form, large toad-like legs frame a rotund torso, and muscular arms that are manacled and pulling him in.

Molly, you've encountered this man once before when you entered the city. He approaches Gustav right now with a commanding voice. ""I had a gut feeling that you were nothing but trouble when you came into our town."" Gustav turns around. ""I guarantee to you, my friend, I have no idea--"" ""What happened here?"" The Crown's Guard who's been shaken turns around and goes, ""Sir, Flynn. There was a creature. This carnival seemed to create some sort of terrible entity that killed and then created a secondary beast. I watched it with my own eyes from the back row.""

So you walk through the performer's flap, and as you walk out, you can see backed up into the number of tents that are set up, and some of the carts, other members of the circus are hiding, and as soon as you exit out the front and they see you before the Crown's Guard, they all immediately scatter and vanish to the nearby shadows, out of sight.

Last we left off, our slowly gathering band of adventurers had begun to have their stories intertwine in the city of Trostenwald, on the southern reaches of western Wynandir on the continent of Wildemount. Here we had Nott and Caleb who had been traveling southward coming and meeting, in the center of the tavern, the Nestled Nook Inn, with Jester, Beauregard, and Fjord. They were invited to a nearby carnival that had begun preparing for their performance later that evening, in which they met Yasha and Molly. After swapping some stories, earning and losing some gold, they began to gather at the outskirts of the Ustaloch, the lake right on the eastern edge of Trostenwald, for the first opening performance of the Fletching and Moondrop Carnival of Curiosities. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

However, during a musical performance by this young dwarven girl whose voice was this mysterious, magically enchanting experience, a member of the audience rose up and began to transform into a terrible undead creature that began to lash out, killing another member of the audience, who then began to become one of these same creatures. You all, grabbing your weapons from Yasha, who had been keeping them stashed away, leapt into the fray, slaughtered both of these terrible beasts, just in time for the crownsguard to rush in and ask you what the hell happened. After information had been gathered of who was immediately available and responsible for this carnival, Gustav, Bo the Breaker, and Molly were marked to be arrested. One of the guards was escorted outside of the tent by Yasha, who was going to show him where this young dwarven girl was currently resting, and upon being led astray to the wrong tent, she just ran into the distant hills and vanished.

E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,LIAM,Why would I do that to leave the inn? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,LAURA,So we can find out why there are zombies. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,LIAM,Why wouldn't I just walk out of the inn? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,MATT,It means he can use to try and disguise himself. Hide features. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,TALIESIN,It'd be a little tricky for me. I look like what I'm going to look like. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,TALIESIN,But the rest of you could do a little work. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,LIAM,Why shouldn't we just wait for it all to blow over? We didn't do anything. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,TALIESIN,I tend to find these things don't blow over necessarily as more they just eventually decide someone's guilty and take their revenge on them. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,LIAM,Do you find yourself in situations like this often? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,TALIESIN,"Not this particular one, but yes. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,TRAVIS,"Older, white-haired, with a beard. Just very simple peasant's clothes. Maybe a bit of a farmer or a land worker. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,MATT,"Okay, easily enough. Basic browns and tans and general farm worker's tunic and supplies. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,MATT,"At a distance, at like three or four feet would be passable and walking quickly by. Upon close inspection, you could see through it. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,LIAM,Is it like one of those old kids toys where you use the magnet to pull the little filings up? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,LIAM,Herr Woolly. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E2, Campaign 2 Episode 2 A Show of Scrutiny,MATT,"All right. Between making your skin tone more of a natural tan, peach humanoid color, bring the hood up. You actually pull some of your hair forward and adhere it a bit around the horns so that it looks almost like a cluster of hair in the front. You manage to tuck in and tie your robe behind you, your usual clothing, and then using an over-robe to hide most of the material, and you look like a dude passing through. So with that your disguises are complete, your spells are cast. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

Last we left off, this intrepid band of slowly converging individual stories into some semblance of an adventuring party have found themselves caught up in an investigation. There was a carnival you attended, which Mollymauk was a part of, that had a terrible scenario occur. An older man who was at the carnival had been transformed in the middle of a performance into some horrible undead creature that attacked and assaulted other people within the tent. You defeated it and since have all been under investigation and been told you can't leave the town. To try and absolve yourselves of any sort of doubt, you've begun to investigate what the cause is for this strange transformation. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"You've gone around the town asking questions, meeting individuals, eventually finding yourselves back at the tent in the middle of the night, past midnight, in the early hours of the morning, sneaking into tents and asking members of the carnival what they may know about what has transpired. Upon speaking with a number of members of the carnival, two of the guards that were on site suddenly fell dead where they were standing, writhing in pain as they passed. You watched as a large shadow, which you had confirmed being fiendish in nature, leapt northward towards the Ustaloch and out of sight as both Fjord and Caleb rushed out of the main tent to see the center of the camp where these two bodies begin to rise up, two more of the freshly transformed undead creatures now angered and looking about for something to feast upon. And that was where we left off. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"Eight points of damage. As you elbow across, wham! You watch as the jaw hangs and dislodges a bit, and as its head turns towards you, you reach with your other first and it catches it in the middle of the air and it tries to bite at your arm, but the jaw hangs open, not able to actually find any purchase in your arm. I believe that ends your turn. Caleb, you're up. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LIAM,I am going to move over a bit towards that carriage and I pull the diamond out of my component pouch and a small prismatic ball forms over it. I take my other hand and spin it really fast and little ice shards start shooting out of the side. I take it with the free hand and I'm going to throw it like a fucking baseball pitcher at the one closest to Beauregard. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"Nine points of cold damage to it. You watch as it's trying to bite with no effect towards Beau's arm as she's pulling away. The sphere slams into the side of its shoulder, it would be this side, and it pulls back. You watch as the arm breaks a bit and the ice shards coalesce around the outside of the armor and linger with this frost and mist that sprays off the impact. It looks fairly damaged. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LIAM,"Question, am I supposed to roll initiative for Frumpkin as well? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

The ice explodes in its side and Mollymauk comes walking out of the tent, both of the scimitars spinning in his hand like this dervish entity.

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,All right. Are we dumping these bodies or what? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TRAVIS,"Yes, kick them out. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"Okay. (thud, thud) The two transformed guard corpses now lie there. One an ashy mess, the other in three pieces. Left along the bank of the water. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,I get out and I start positioning them like maybe they were having a romantic tryst. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TRAVIS,We've been doing that already. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TRAVIS,That's actually a great idea. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MARISHA,Towards us? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"No, a little bit further away and then has hit the land. The figures are currently taking things out of the boat. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,They're late night fishermen. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MARISHA,I think they're fishermen. Let's keep moving. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MARISHA,North. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,SAM,The toad went due north? Like straight into the water? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,That's the direction it was traveling. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,Can I look for toad tracks? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,11. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"11. It's hard to really make out what tracks are what. You do see a few heavy impacts in the mud. Some of them looks like it could have been the bodies being rolled, but not too far from where you are, there's one big smack in the mud. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,Like something heavy impacted. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,Fjord! Come look at this! This is definitely toad tracks. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TRAVIS,"In the shape that it's in, this print. Are their toes pointing in a specific direction? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TRAVIS,14. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,You can see the heavy impact has a few subtler imprints. There do appear to be two hands and two feet though the water has washed in and gotten rid of a lot of the details at this point. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,You can vaguely tell they appear to be facing towards the water. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,SAM,Could be. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MARISHA,Which way did the fisherman go? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,They are a little bit to the west along the bank in the direction of the city. The city is northwest of you currently. If you were to continue around the lake-- →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LIAM,Because the city is on the lake so we're just around the edge of the lake. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,Exactly. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MARISHA,"I think we should keep heading away from the city, right? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LIAM,It depends on what we're going to do. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,SAM,If we're chasing the toad it seems like we need to find a boat and go out into the water. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,So we head towards that boat that hit land. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,SAM,Steal that boat? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,If we go towards the toad we are going to fight the toad. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,SAM,"Well no, we are just going to find the toad. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,SAM,You said this. We're camping and waiting and resting. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LIAM,"The other thing we can do, but it will take some time, need about an hour. Frumpkin is a cat but Frumpkin does not need to be a cat. I could fly him over as well but I need time, I need about an hour. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,I hadn't really thought about it. It's something I can in theory do. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,Because you used your blood on it? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,"No. This would also break my short rest, wouldn't it? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"Actually, I'd say for the points of expediency, with the time it has taken you and have these discussion at the edge, it's pushing 2:30 like 3:00 in the morning and both of you have finished the short rest. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,I'm going to use Hunter's Bane really quickly and look at the track for a second. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,"Yeah, I'm going to do both of those. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LIAM,"I changed my mind, I believe I used arcane recovery during the day. So forget it. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,Better than one. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,Yay 12 hit points. I'm going to see if I can help with the tracking because I'm going to start actively tracking this particular creature. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,Make a survival check. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,Survival check? Which I have advantage on. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,You have advantage on it because it's a feat. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,18. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"Looking at the imprint you follow back the direction of the carnival and you can see the path because it was a beeline toward the Ustaloch. The best you can tell because the water picks up there's no trail to pick up in the water. Looking at the trajectory, it was very intently making its way towards the water either avoiding making any more tracks and making it difficult to follow. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,Guy went into the water. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,That's what we figured. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,Do you think he's trying to swim all the way to the other side or you think he's just going around the lake? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TRAVIS,We're not lucky enough to have any small boats along the shores that have been beached? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TRAVIS,"Yeah, we got like four hours until sunrise. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,SAM,Do any of us know what's beyond? Like what's on the other side of this lake? Is it a mountain? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,Straight across. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"The other side of the lake, from what you know, because you were traveling southward towards it, there's no major landmass on the other side of the lake. It's just open field. You notice what looks to be some sort of a bulge in the landmass in the center. Too large to be the toad, but it does seem to break up the water horizon from that vantage point. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,I don't know. I'm not sure. Maybe. Could be. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,It's not like a mental tracking ability. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,It's to be able to see details of the specific type of tracks. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,I legitimately do not know how it works. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,Sorry. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"Just like any other tracking, you still need to have things to follow. You can read damage in the forest to see if something barreled through. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,You can follow tracks. You can see blood splatters. Any sort of thing that can give you an idea of where something went that is of those types of creatures. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"You do, actually. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,TALIESIN,Religion check? 15. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"15? Now that they've mentioned a fiend, it seems familiar, but the most you can get is a memory that you don't know where it came from, this memory of horrible toad-like demonic creatures that exist to the far east in Xhorhas. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"That's as much as you can recall. But you're definitely sitting here now with this memory that comes to mind, going, ""This whole time! This whole time--"" →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LIAM,If we can get back into town somehow. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,SAM,We're going to go shopping at three in the morning? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MARISHA,Investigation? Seven. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"Seven. It's hard to tell in the dark, unfortunately. Your human eyes prevent you from finding any details in the vicinity without a light source.

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,LAURA,Can I Detect Magic on it? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"You may. So you take a little bit of time concentrating on it. At the end of the spell, you send out your extended consciousness, but they do not resonate anything magical. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"All right. As you guys sit here in the quiet, you can hear the crickets now; the rest of the sound of the forest has fallen away and the din of the battle has vanished. The moonlight gets a bit brighter as the moon climbs higher in the sky. And you all kind of look around at each other. Through this haphazard series of events you've come to assemble a skillset that seems to overlap pretty well. And hopefully it's enough to clear your name. But we'll find that out next week. So we're going to end the episode. We'll be back to continue that thread next Thursday. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,SAM,What does that mean? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MATT,"That means there's no experience points, but at the end of each major story beat, like a big moment that I see fit, then everyone will level up together. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E3, Campaign 2 Episode 3 The Midnight Chase,MARISHA,So do you see fit? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

Upon gathering your supplies after a night's rest, you managed to, through the trade of a bottle of wine, get passage across the lake onto the central island, which at one time housed the abode of a witch that had long collapsed. Waiting for nightfall, you approached the center of the grove that existed there on the island and found near this ruin this same fiendish nergaliid, as well as Toya, the 12-year-old dwarf girl who had been affixed to him for the performances in the carnival. You did battle with this large fiendish entity who summoned a cluster of imps and managed to knock a few of you pretty heavily to the ground before you finished it off. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

As you've all now taken a moment to yourselves, you can hear the sound of the nearby crickets getting more and more deafening as the silence crawls over the center of the lake. Toya, the young girl, still lies unconscious. The remains of the devil toad, still partially burnt from the final blow delivered by Fjord, are mostly intact above its shoulders, head, and its legs.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"You sought the answer to this endeavor, you found the devil toad, or the nergaliid, as you discovered, was responsible. You hunted it down, slew it, brought its head back, and after arguing with a very tired and wanting to get it over with lawmaster in Trostenwald, managed to convince her enough to let you off the hook and leave most of the standing legal issues with Gustav, thus disbanding the circus and setting you and Yasha free. Yasha went on her own path while the rest of you, the six of you, decided strength in numbers, and at the time being, you all seem to enjoy each other's company. Purchasing a fresh map, looking at your future prospects and your dwindling funds, you decided to head northward, towards the city of Zadash by way of the Golden Road, past the city of Alfield.

The well-packed dirt of the ten-foot roadway gives you a clear path towards your next destination. The gentle creak of the cart mingles with the clomping of the horse hooves as you push forward. The midday air is warmer than you expected. The sky's common gray presence is broken into smaller cloud patches, the victorious blue peeking through. You guys continue for a few hours, talking amongst yourselves a bit. If there are any questions you wish to ask each other, now is the time. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Is it? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,Yes. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,What does it mean? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,It means that you're on a cart. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,It was the chariot. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,"Would you normally, you know, hijack a caravan like that? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,"I mean, we have in the past. If we are confident we can get away with it, we would. We could-- →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,Can you get away with something like that? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,"There's a lot of people in that caravan though, it seems like a risky maneuver. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,That's a pretty big matzo ball there. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,"And stealing is wrong. But if you did it, could you get away with it? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,We could probably get away with it. Why? You want to follow them and rob their shit? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,Just going off what you said earlier. I don't want to change your behavior just because you're with us all of a sudden. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,"I mean, sure. Let's go do it. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,He's just trying to get you in trouble. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,"Oh, okay. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,I am not. Merely asking a question. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Would you join in in the stand off? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,"Wait, what does that-- →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Would you join the stagecoach robbery? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,"If we're pointing them down, reach for the sky! →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,"Careful, those fingers are loaded. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,"Yeah, but I would ask. Are you asking because that is something that you have no experience with or are you wondering maybe is that something that we could join you in? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,"Only because I have no experience in it, I was just curious what it was that you might have done, you know, previously. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Did you hijack a cart? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,"No, we were more small-time thieves. We wouldn't typically hijack moving caravans. Usually we'd wait until they parked somewhere and then just go sneak on and steal something out of the back. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,Mostly whatever we can walk away with. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,The things with moving carts of that big a family is they tend to prep. You don't know what kind of people or weapons they have with them. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,Always go for a sure thing. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,"You know how we're pretty sure that everyone on this road's going to kill us? Yeah, everyone else thinks that, too. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,Fair enough. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,"But if you need me to teach you how to steal, you can tag along sometime. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,"I might take you up on that, yeah. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,All right. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,Interesting. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Continuing on your path, I want to ask which two of you are taking point in keeping an eye on the road and the landscape around you as you progress? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,(fake cough) Beau. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,"Yeah, I'll take watch. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,"Oh, sorry. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,Okay. Beau and who else? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,So generous of you. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,You want to do it? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,"I was going to say, yeah. I'll take a round. I'm used to keeping an eye out on the road. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,So the two of you are taking point up until you guys decide to change it when it comes to travel along the road. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,It's just general perception? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Yes. I would like you both, currently about an hour's journey past that intersection with the other caravan, to make a perception check. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Ooh! I bet someone's going to try to hijack our shit on the road just like we were talking about then. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Not too bad. 18. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,Yeah! Smash. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"18 and eight. Actually, both of you don't really notice anything. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Oh. Take that back. Take it back. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Both of you keeping an eye out, the hills continue to roll. You see patches of trees and small wooded areas. Grass field is tall but it's beautiful and the light breeze that blows through, you can see the waves of wind as they come across. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,You can hear the faint sound of it moving the fields across. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Is there a tree that looks climbable that I could get a vantage point? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"There is. It's maybe about 600 feet off the road, but you can try and head over there if you want to. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,"Plus we've been traveling for what? About hour and a half, two hours now? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"I'd say total right now, you've been probably on the road for about four hours. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Oh. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,We should probably rest the horse for just a bit. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,(laughter) →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Sure. Anyone want to take a quick pee break? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Yes. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,"Yes, please. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,All right. Let's go over to the bushes. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,All right. So you guys leave the cart on the road or do you take it off to the side? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,Should leave a guard with the-- →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,We should lead it off the road. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Can we take it with us fairly easily? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"I mean, you can. The progress will slow a bit because you're now taking it through the hills and the field and having to push the cart through the grass. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,"No, we should take it off the road. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Just off the road a little bit. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,"Just off the road but we don't have to go all the way to the tree, I can-- →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,I'll sit with the cart for the first roll. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,I'll stay with you. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,Where are you going to do? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,I'm just going to go check out this tree over here. See if I can get a little better vantage. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,"Okay. I have a bird that can go probably higher than the tree, if you want. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,"Yeah, kind of forgot about that. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,Would you like me to do that? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Maybe she likes climbing trees. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,Or you could. I don't want to rob you of the joy of climbing a good tree. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,"Or falling out of it, which we would really enjoy. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,That would be actually extremely-- →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,"Both are very pleasant, but I do not necessarily need that to feel fulfilled. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,"Okay. Well, I will sit in the field then and give him a little chuck under the chin and-- oh, wait. Before I go away, am I looking for anything specific? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Just people coming. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,People coming. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"As the rest of you take a moment to step off to the side of the road, pull out some of your travel supplies to feed the horse, give it a rest. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Pick some flowers. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Pick some flowers, which you can find. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"They're wildflowers. They're bright white, scattered and simple, but they're beautiful in their own right. You all take a bit to relieve yourselves a little ways off the road. You make your way towards the nearest tree and it's a cluster of about five or six that are nearby, this pocket where it seems like some seeds long ago got dropped by a bird, probably, over the sky, and then proceeded to grow and sprout. The lowest branch is about ten feet up, so you're going to have to take a quick leap and try and climb some of it. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,I wanted to wait for Caleb. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Oh, that's right, you're waiting there. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Never mind. You see that tree and you go, ""I'll get to that later."" →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,It's a damn good tree. I do miss climbing trees. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,Your eyes cloud over. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,"They do. As the bird is flying, just for a second, I say: You know, ordinarily-- I can't hear you, but he's a cat almost all the time, so this is a rarity. You'll be able to climb many trees, many other times, but we should take advantage of him. Well, okay. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,None of us were nearby when he was saying all of that. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"No, you guys were quite a ways off. No one was in earshot. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,Maybe not this. You're too focused. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,"We worked out that he could-- okay, great. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,There's bugs in my nose. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,It tickles a little bit. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,"Shove it all in, everybody! →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"To be fair, your face itches in general from the sheer amount of filth that's on it. It's hard to really differentiate. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,"In the middle of the field you hear: Ooh, look at that! What do I see? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,Make a perception check for your birdie. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,That's a nine. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Glancing over and doing a wide pass around as everyone begins to gather their things and head towards the cart, the road's pretty open. At this point, the previous caravan is invisible from that height, the hills close that distance. You don't see anything coming your way. It seems pretty open and safe. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,Okay. I keep flying for a little bit longer. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,Okay. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,I lift Beau up to the branch just because. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Okay. Feels like childhood. Do you want up here? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,"Yeah, I'll jump! →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,"All right, I lift her up. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,We sit up in the branches. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Okay, cool. It's a nice view. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,I've never climbed a tree before. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Really? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Yeah. This is really pretty. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,What do you think lives in that hole? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Probably very small unicorns. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Have you ever seen an unicorn? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,"Yes, I've seen many. The little ones can be as small as hamsters. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Eventually, you all gather yourselves again back at the wagon, cart it back onto the road, and head northward. Another few hours pass before the sun begins to set. As the sky grows darker, the clouds from the north-northeast begin to filter in with a colder wind. You get the sense that the warm day that you had is coming to a close and who knows how long the current cold weather will keep. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,You can see your breath. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Not super thick, but when you exhale you see a bit of the breath before you. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"There are no mountains anywhere in the vicinity. You're in the center of the rolling hills. There is a cluster of trees you could go to that's about 300 feet or so off the road.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,It'll do. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LAURA,Can we get the horse over to them? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,It takes you a little bit. You spend about 45 minutes in pitch dark keeping an eye in that direction before you come upon the tree.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,LIAM,"Now, hold on. I pull a rag out, and I (poof) one of the Dancing Lights, and make that hooded lantern again so that you can see. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"With that light, it's easy enough to find some small kindling. There's not a whole lot in the vicinity, mainly being that it's an open field.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TALIESIN,We can chop it up. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Fjord, as darkness takes your mind, dreamless like most, you await the emptiness of sleep to carry you to the day. Your sense of body fades, but your mind and the dark linger. Minutes, hours, days. Time loses real sense and meaning, but you're conscious for it and that is almost maddening, in that split second or endless stretch of experience that you're currently unable to express. As the time passes, the air grows colder around you. The faint shimmer of shifting midnight blue, muted and distant, now showing endless depth before you, rippling. You begin to flail about, your senses returning with the dropping temperature, but there is resistance to your limbs as you push in the space around you. You're sluggish. There's force. It's not air, it's water. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

You spiral over and over again, the darkness swallowing you, tightening around you as this dance, this shape, this endless coil, this spiral around you. As the current tugs at you, battering you, you cannot fight any more as the increased power of the current pulls on your form. You cough, and the freezing waters rush into your body, the briny taste of salt water stinging your insides. Your wincing eyes open with the pain that clutches the interior of your chest, only to see a gargantuan mass moving through the water around you, like a massive noose closing in. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

As you get closer, about 100 feet outside the city, you watch as the droves of people are beginning to get-- at least either the ones that are actively fleeing have made it out of the city, or in the process the stragglers are still coming through. You see a young human man with scrappy, tattered brown hair, a bit of blood dripping down his face, running before his back arches and he falls into the grass. You can see an arrow protruding from his back. At that point, you can see, standing up from behind one of the exterior walls of the city, a humanoid creature stretching up to about seven feet tall, muscular torso with thin dog-like legs.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"As you enter, you see the crownsguard went northward but the one creature that you saw charge in went straight towards the heart. Right now you can see there's two main streets that bisect this small village. There's one that goes at an angle, northwest to southeast. One that goes right towards the center, west to east. As you head towards the center you can see the flames are more near that central square. As you guys begin to run, push past a few more people, the smoke is starting to billow up and you can see now there's embers rising and then falling. This very faint ashy rain of small points of reddish-orange light that begin to fall with the ash. As you turn around one of the buildings, there's one of the side walls and four crownsguard all ducked down behind the wall with crossbows and longbows, all back behind it. You can see one that's adorned with more ornate armor. You see a person there with elven features, but hint at a mixed lineage. They have their helmet on the ground, showing shoulder-length blond hair that's turned red in places from a spattering of gore. Through gritted teeth they curse in pain as the bandages are applied to what you can see is a wound right around the midsection in the thigh area. Another soldier is in the process of wrapping it. You watch as they go, ""Gah! You fool, bind the wound, don't stuff it."" Goes and they pull a bolt back into the crossbow and nock it at the ready. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,We do. We have to use the cover of the buildings. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,"All right, I think I can do something that would make them fire many of their arrows at something, but not us. Should I do that and then as soon as they fire their arrows we can run? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,Diversions are absolutely-- →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,SAM,"Diversions! That's what it's called, it's a diversion. All right, may I move, is that a thing? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"There you go. As the figure leaps over the wall and begins making a run towards the center area, about four different arrows pass through its form before one of these gnoll creatures goes lumbering forward and slashes out to it. This gnoll, interestingly enough-- the other ones you see and the one you saw before the city are all built and muscular. This one seems to be porous. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"With a brief bit of view, you can see there's clumps of fur and exposed bone and part of its skull is just pushing out of its snout with teeth gnashing.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"All right. The whistle has a bit of volume to it. Unfortunately, with the sound of all the breaking of furniture, them all growling at each other, and the general screams in the vicinity, it's lost in the chaos. It's not necessarily a quiet atmosphere to draw a guard's attention. The gnolls don't seem to care much for a whistle around the window.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,Can I go in through the window? →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"You do. As you go through the window, because they've mostly shifted into the other room now; that's where you see them moving. They're not in the room that's closest to you, so you go jump through the window, over the mass, make your way through the living room, and you watch as they're exiting the door. You get all the way through. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,I thought it was much closer than that. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Unfortunately, no. But you do manage to make it all the way to this door there. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,That's bad disadvantage. Fog of war. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Well, here's what you do. As you rush through to go after them, as they're fleeing out the other side, you come to the doorway and you can see there's one gnoll right in front of you that hasn't noticed you rushing behind it. It's currently throwing a corpse of one of the villagers onto a cart that's sitting right outside of that door. That cart, which is piled up with other corpses, and bags, and whatever things they were robbing from the inside of this building that they've thrown onto this cart. You can now see there's four gnolls that are gathered around it in the process of throwing things onto it, and it looks like they're getting ready to start pushing it. They haven't noticed your arrival, as you've just darted into the doorway. What are you going to do? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,"Okay, I'm going to double ba-- Ah, I can't move anymore, can I? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,"Oh, really? →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,Because you already used your bonus action. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,"Ooh. Great, I'll do that. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,You just go into the dodge action. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,I'll just hold back and wait. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"Right, so you're holding back in the doorway, and you're ready to use the door to help defend you if it needs to. Okay, that ends Beau's turn. It's now their turn. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"All right. I wonder, does it add your damage bonus to it, or the original weapon, because it is your strength throwing it back. Pardon me, folks, while we're figuring out new abilities they can use. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,So six total. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"These guys are going to begin pushing the cart and it's going to move at half their movement to there.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,TRAVIS,I was hoping to just be-- Because I can't see that far-- to be right here to hit the only guy that could see me on the ground there. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"All righty. In the back of the alleyway, one of the gnolls stands thicker, more angry, and more ornate than the rest of the pack.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"They look natural, as opposed to metal, like long, bony spines that are put onto it, both as an ornate adornment, or possibly just a means of defense and to look scary.

E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,"It looks over towards the one that's right next to Beau and goes, (snarling). The one that's in the middle of the area with you hears that, grins, and then gets an extra attack against you, with disadvantage. And a four. That defense is helping you out. It goes to strike again, and as it comes out with its claw, it's putting its spear to the side. →",A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MARISHA,I do a little duck. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together
E5, Campaign 2 Episode 5 The Open Road,MATT,It misses you entirely. That's going to end its turn at the moment. Then it goes to the guards on this end. These guards are going to fan out. →,A1,Arc 1: Come Together

He fires and it goes wide, you see it vanish into the rising cloud of embers and flame. That's going to end the guards' turn.
