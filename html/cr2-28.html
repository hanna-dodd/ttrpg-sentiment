<dd data-ts="00:00:06" id="l0h0m6s">We have returning this week our fantastic guests, Ashly Burch and Sumalee Montano. They've been amazing, we're excited to have them back, and going to see what this next adventure of the story's going to have. Before we get to that, we have some announcements to get through, beginning with our fantastic sponsor and friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

<dd data-ts="00:00:25" id="l0h0m25s">D&amp;D Beyond, everybody, two new products have been announced on D&amp;D Beyond. The Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica, alternate title is That's So Ravnica, available for preorder now on the D&amp;D Beyond marketplace, officially will be released on November 9th. Also, The Wayfarer's Guide to Eberron, alternate title, The Werfernder's Gerd to Erberron, available for purchase now on the D&amp;D Beyond marketplace. As a reminder, anyone who already has purchased the Legendary bundle can pre-order or purchase these and any future content at a 15% discount, everyone. Which has the savings baked right in. I've been using D&amp;D Beyond for a while now, and they just redid their layout, took me a while to get used to it. For those of you at home using D&amp;D Beyond, I have a couple of tips, pointers, for the new layout, to remind myself where things are layed out. It's like little mnemonics. It's a weird thing. On the right side of the screen, you can remember "L E F," so right sort of like, LEF, left, sort of. That's where loot, equipment and features are. On the left, is "I A A," insight and awareness. I'll put that down here. Then in the middle, is "A T R," which is things you can add to roll. ATR. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h0m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:02:30" id="l0h2m30s">Onto the next bit of business. For those who haven't seen the announcement we had today, we are headed to London MCM Comic Expo in October, actually. October 27th and 28th, Critical Role will be in London! Super excited about that. We're looking forward to meeting a lot of you European Critters out there. We've been trying to get an opportunity to go over there for a while, so glad we finally have the chance to come and hang out with you folks across the pond. You can go to critrole.com for details on it, and we look forward to seeing you then. Also, as a reminder for next week, we will not be broadcasting an episode next Thursday. Instead, we'll be doing a live broadcast Friday evening from Indianapolis. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h2m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:02:30" id="l0h2m30s">It will be airing, this is Friday, August 3rd, at 9:00pm Eastern time, that's 6:00pm Pacific. So it'll be an hour earlier than what you are used to, but it'll be our live show at the Murat Theater in Indianapolis. Super excited about that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h2m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:02:30" id="l0h2m30s">It's going to be crazy. It's going to be absolutely nuts.

Thank you for your patience. Go check it out if you want to. Be sure to check out the Beast of Winter DLC for Deadfire is coming out soon. You can pick up the game at versesevil.com/criticalrole, and it's a fun one, so check it out if you haven't yet. Reminder that we do our Wyrmwood giveaways during the breaks, and they're going to be happening over here at the Critical Role Twitch chat, so I'll prompt you when we come to our mid break today, but we need you to come over to the Critical Role chat to enter the giveaway, and then head on back to Geek &amp; Sundry, or wherever else you're watching. That'll be at twitch.tv/criticalrole. Talks Machina, our after show discussion about what happens this week will be happening next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here on the Geek &amp; Sundry Twitch and Alpha, where our fantastic host Brian W. Foster interviews us, and makes us feel a little better about ourselves after the chaos the previous week had. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h4m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:07:30" id="l0h7m30s">Welcome back, everyone. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein, who had acquired two new allies in Keg, the dwarven fighter, and Nila, the firbolg druid, had made their way to the city of Shadycreek Run. After making your way through the town, spending an evening staying at the Landlocked Lady, and getting some information about where to find info about your quarry, and where your friends may have been taken to after they were captured by the Iron Shepherds, a traveling slavers crew. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h7m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:08:08" id="l0h8m8s">They are the worst. You went and had a discussion at the Estate Sybaritic with Ophelia Mardun, of whom you were sent by The Gentleman to interface with and do a deed for her a little over two weeks ago. There it seemed that the intent of your job placed here in this city has aligned with your current goal of freeing your friends and seeking vengeance against the Iron Shepherds, as they currently work for a competitive family to the Mardun house, and in response to them destroying parts of the trade route that the Mardun family enjoys through the center and southern sides of the empire, they wish you to instill damage upon their traders as well, by eliminating the Iron Shepherds. You were given some ideas as to where you might find some help, you gathered your things, made your way north into the seemingly corrupted and haunted Savalierwood, to seek information about these Iron Shepherds and where they are. You narrowly avoided two large, immensely mutated, bone-spurred bear creatures. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h8m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:08:08" id="l0h8m8s">You sought out and cased the exterior of the Sour Nest, which is the fortress that was given to the Iron Shepherds by the family that pays them and keeps them in their employ. You decided to send your new druid friend, Nila, in the form of a small mouse, over the wall, delivery via owl. She snuck through some portions of the fortress to gather intel, and to get an idea of where you were going and what may reside within. A few close calls, and some discovery of what can be expected within the interior, you made your way back, safely, to join your friends. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h8m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:10:22" id="l0h10m22s">Upon accidentally spooking one of the outer guards who were walking the perimeter of the wall that surrounds the Sour Nest, you immediately picked up what you had, fled south, back through the Savalierwood, on your way to Shadycreek Run to look for means of possibly finding more help for this endeavor when nightfall hits, and whatever else you can do to prepare for the necessary evacuation of your allies. And that's where we left off. Mighty Nein, as you've charged back through the purplish-gray corrupted Savalierwood, the midday sun barely visible through slight peaking cracks through the canopy above you, leaping and hearing these large growling sounds and hoots, you beeline it as best you can, and as quickly as you can, before you breach into the outskirts of the northern side of the North Clover area. You're now between some of the nearby buildings, and you immediately begin to see some of the relatively shady denizens of this north side of Shadycreek Run that glance over their shoulder, their hooded selves watching you as you pass. You slow your gait, as you are no longer fleeing, per se, but you have made your way back to the town.

You then begin to see that area of the wall that you had noticed, Nott, that had seemed to be bending, and the vines have actually curled over and bent it downward. It seems that whatever this little section of the forest is-- whatever protective magics that once contained this outer vicinity have begun to give in to the corruption of the Savalierwood. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h38m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:39:45" id="l0h39m45s">Frumpkin darts up, jumping from tree edge to tree edge, gliding through. There are numerous layers of similar walls. Three different layers, looks like. Whereas the outskirts or the perimeter of this beautiful, protected, ancient gravesite that once held this corruption at bay has slowly collapsed inward, and a new boundary is placed. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h39m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:39:45" id="l0h39m45s">Then that boundary has fallen. As the corruption pulls in further, a new boundary is built. That third boundary now seems to be in the process of giving in, just like its previous constructs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h39m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:39:45" id="l0h39m45s">Within this third area, you can see not just a lack of snow, or ice, or the winter chill, but a nearly humid summer warmth, something more akin to the southern tip of the Empire or even Menagerie Coast. It is an unexpected and extreme shift in temperature and weather. There is something unnatural, or at least magical, that maintains this little pocket of untouched paradise. There you can see small pools, bits of bog where the soft green and browns of compost fall into green, thick, algae-covered bits of water. You can see dozens and dozens of stone tablets, about a foot to two feet high, with bits of script across them, too far to see, that have partially fallen or leaning. At which point Frumpkin looks around and this entire area, from the outer very edge where that first perimeter wall was found, to the inside has all been graves, most taken back by the Savalierwood as it slowly crushes whatever this location is at its source. On the far end, towards the core and the back-- the northern side of this final, defending pocket of uncorrupted forest-- you can see a stone building, maybe 20 by 30 feet, built as an old stone steeple. It stands windowless, open, and the floor of it to each open window overgrown with green vine and leaf. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h39m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The one on the opposite side, you have to pull out one of your metallic hooks that slips through a space in the wood and manage to pull it up on the side a little bit. You're essentially reverse-picking it with two hooked picks from the opposite side. It takes you a little longer, until eventually it hangs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=2h14m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
