<dd data-ts="00:00:00" id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Before we go ahead and jump into tonight's story, we have some announcements to get through. First and foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by our fantastic friends at Marvel Puzzle Quest. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:00:25" id="l0h0m25s">We love Marvel Puzzle Quest and they love that we love them. In fact, Puzzle Quest had a bunch of critters come up to their booth at Gen-con to say hi, and they wanted to thank the community for being so awesome and welcoming. The game is legitimately awesome. It is so awesome, it is so epic that me talking about it doesn't do justice. Really it needs another artform. One that is an amazing theatrical experience and expression of joy and emotion. It needs opera. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h0m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Better rewards and challenges you can recruit Lockjaw the inhuman doggo. For more chances to summon Black Bolt, other Inhumans, and Kamala Khan, and boost the power of your superhero squad. Last but not least, for a limited time you can also recruit the Silver Surfer and Thanos and Star-Lord and the cosmic legends pack. (speaking) Oh shit, I forgot my props.

<dd data-ts="00:06:19" id="l0h6m19s">Last but not least, as many of you are aware in this string of natural disasters that keeps hitting, there was a terrible earthquake that hit Mexico City and the surrounding areas this past week. We want to implore people to do whatever you can to donate and help those who are currently recovering in the relief effort in the areas that were heavily hit by this earthquake. Having lived through a number of earthquakes in my youth, it's a very scary and very dangerous thing, and nothing on the scale of what they're undergoing there, so if you have the opportunity, we want to promote UNICEF and Oxfam México. The links will be in the chat soon, but if you can, please give. It all helps and people who are in the middle of that scenario will be very thankful.

<dd data-ts="00:08:54" id="l0h8m54s">Hello, and welcome back. You guys can discuss this in a minute. Last we left off, Vox Machina had been climbing their way through the bowels of an undead risen primordial titan, previously having found information about the history of Vecna from the Knowing Mistress regarding his ascension, the avatar form, and the drive he needs to create a miracle before he can truly embody and begin to grow the power to really exemplify the abilities of the god that he has now become. You began to make your way through the interior where you battled corrupted earth elementals that existed in him naturally. You began to battle undead skeletons and undead trolls. Eventually, after making your way towards a series of key-trapped rooms, one of which seemed to be some sort of mirrored incinerator, you made your way towards an upward tunnel and encountered a number of disciples, cultists of the Undying King, Vecna. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h8m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:08:54" id="l0h8m54s">In this confrontation, you encountered face-to-face a Sphere of Annihilation, and through some clever uses of short-range teleportation and losing one's face, you managed to stop them before, one, they destroyed your party, or managed to escape to alert others of your presence, and last we left off, you all were resting within that hallway, thinking about what the next course of action is. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h8m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:14:28" id="l0h14m28s">Okay. You continue up the staircase, the steps being wider than the previous ones you've seen before. Eventually, you pass through the carved tunnel of a cave-in up the steps. The next chamber reveals itself naught but 25 feet upwards. It opens up. You find yourselves standing within a small building ruin, but the walls have fallen around you. You can see the bare structure around you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:14:28" id="l0h14m28s">Elements of the base floor, rubble and broken slate. You see around you what must have been a once-colossal courtyard or a commons for the dwarven city of Thomara, with varying levels and paths and platforms holding rare types of now petrified leafless trees scattered amongst this thoroughfare, climbing up dozens of feet like frozen bolts of lightning forever reaching in vain. You see dead-littered paths, weaving between stout multi-leveled buildings of Thomara make, corpses that have been torn apart and are twitching, shifting on their own, the occasional hand pulling its way across. Whatever bits and pieces of undead here remain, they are not functional. They have been so sundered through the ages or other sort of confrontation, and yet are cursed to forever twitch and wander. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:14:28" id="l0h14m28s">Your eyes, as they focus in on this interior, you glance to the opposite side. You see the ghost of this past beauty of the city surrounding you is now currently defiled on a mass scale. Over half of this 300-foot-wide cavern appears to have collapsed or is currently crushed under an invading mass of black earth and rock, unlike the rest of the titan's interior. The familiar smell of wet earth and ancient decay is now mixed with another familiar scent of cold ash and iron dust, the smell of the Shadowfell. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:14:28" id="l0h14m28s">At this distance, you can see the rough shape of three carved archways at the base of this inverted mass of earth that curves down and collapses half of this cavern. About 40 or so feet apart. You can see at each of these entrances, there are some figures, some shapes. They are too far from you at the moment, hundreds of feet away from you, to make any sort of clear vision, but you see a few bits of torchlight in the distance and shifting shadows near those entrances. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The sky above you glows a sickly teal color as the darkened storm above is obscured by the crackle of the arcane barrier that encases the city. Glancing at the size of the barrier and the points of origin, you can see that only the inner portion of Thar Amphala is here. The inner wall and everything within.

It gets darker and darker, and you can see before you a hilt of some sort of black blade. It's beautiful and hooked in places.

There's a half-ajar door that's broken, and you push through, being careful not to slam into it or to break it and cause any noise, but you all rush into this chamber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=2h20m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
