I think that's all of our announcements for the evening. That being the case, let's go ahead and pull ourselves in this evening to tonight's episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h5m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="00:07:15" id="l0h7m15s">Hello and welcome back. Goddamn it. (sighs) Welcome back. I'll remember that. Your dungeon master will remember this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:07:15" id="l0h7m15s">So. Last we left off, Vox Machina, in trying to find a way to seal off the growing threat of Vecna, now restored to physical form and seeking ascension and achieving it, you've gone to a number of the deities across the Exandria pantheon of the Prime Gods. Gaining some blessings and gaining bits of essence from these deities to create something called a Prime Trammel, an item that was used previously during the Calamity to seal one of the betrayer gods and could possibly put an end to Vecna's newly ascended form and reign as the only god on the Prime Material plane across the Divine Gate. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:07:15" id="l0h7m15s">Information given to you by the Knowing Mistress sent you beneath an underwater volcano known as Scaldseat, where you proceeded to learn how to breathe water and then step into toxic fume-filled tunnels, where you proceeded to breathe through the water via Grog's jug. Very clever. But finding your way through a short battle with some of the indigenous life forms there, a mother and two children magma bulettes. You headed down deeper into the volcanic caverns of Scaldseat, eventually finding a long-sealed series of chambers by the Allhammer, the deity for craft, family, and legacy, where somewhere supposedly beneath this volcano and hopefully within these long-sealed chambers lies the Core Anvil, where these Prime Trammels can be constructed. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:07:15" id="l0h7m15s">As you made your way through here, hearing the undulating reverberating pounding of some distant piece of machinery, it seemed, heading down the stairs you were put into a hexagonal chamber which had a square of coals and above that, X bars against the wall where in the center you saw a gold inlaid seal, almost. What's the word I'm looking for? An empty triangular shape, a pyramid inverted within this golden seal. And a series of these iron warriors that were embedded in the walls. Behind the stairway, you saw, and you identified upon seeing it, means of smelting metal and other forms of material. When Percival was inspecting one of these warriors, it immediately came to life, and you watched as the glowing outline of each one of these ten-foot-tall, 12-foot-tall metallic warriors glowed bright orange. They each emerged from the walls with these large two-handed greatswords at their side and immediately began to incite conflict. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:07:15" id="l0h7m15s">And that's where we left off, so to begin this fray: Where are you guys placed, currently? Percival, you would probably be right about where that guy emerged. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Convex is outward. It will be about 100 platinum pieces or so to fill each face void. So you take the platinum, you melt it down into the smelter, get it to where it's in the gripped, tong-held metallic reservoir, until it eventually melts down. You then pour it into each of the heads, so 300 platinum utilized to do this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h59m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="01:14:42" id="l1h14m42s">As the door eventually comes to a stop maybe a foot before it reaches the ceiling, black smoke pours in from the other chamber. You watch as it immediately fills the ceiling and then begins to dissipate up the stairway and the hallway above you where you guys originally descended from. You see flashes of sparks and embers through these clouds of black smoke and soot within the chamber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h14m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="01:14:42" id="l1h14m42s">It's obscuring most of your view within the inside. And that heavy pounding, that (pounding) is much louder now.

<dd data-ts="01:14:42" id="l1h14m42s">You can see small streams of glowing orange molten rock within the chamber, which is slightly down and before you. Looks like two small ten-foot-wide rivers of molten rock, metal-- you can't quite tell from here, but it's glowing orange and red, and they both convene and go dark in the center where it looks like they are being covered or obscured by something that you can't quite make out at this distance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h14m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="01:16:33" id="l1h16m33s">What you can make out for the most part is this central platform is raised. It looks like there's a staircase that leads up to a middle platform that is in the center of this larger chamber, and it looks to be a couple of large, heavy platforms or pillars that have roaring flames at the edges of them. You can see beneath it, the two pools of lava that disappear beneath it, and you see a hint of a spiral staircase on each side that curls around the back end of where those two rivers of molten rock meet. Behind that, you see the flashes, (sparking) like these rhythmic engines of sparks that are pouring out of the black smoke that is perpetually filling the upper part of this chamber. However, since now it has a place to escape, the room is slowly revealing the interior. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h16m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="01:16:33" id="l1h16m33s">You can see on top of this platform in the center a large dark metal object, roughly four or five feet from front to back and about three feet wide of dark, jet black metal, with small veins of glowing red and orange that curl around it that occasionally flare with each impact of whatever this rhythmic metal clanging is behind it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h16m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="01:16:33" id="l1h16m33s">As the smoke begins to dissipate even further, more visibility reveals the shape of this object to definitely be that of an anvil. You can see a number of chains that are linked to it on each side that dangle off the edge. You cannot quite see what's at the end of these chains; they're falling off the side of this platform and out of view. You'd have to get closer to see what they are. However, the shape that you now see, right behind this platform, looming at about 20 feet tall from your estimation at this distance, Keyleth, as you are the one who sees this before anybody else does. You see a stocky humanoid form that is looming over the anvil, both of its fists resting on each side of the platform. You can see its trunk-like arms and legs are dark gray stone, and the head carries no face; it is a smooth absence of face. You can see red cables that dangle from the top and the back of the head that are then pulled together in the back like a ponytail, and around the center of its torso and its lower body, these extremely thick layers of leather wrap that make a kilt that dangles past the knees of this giant stone structure that stands there looming over. In one of its hands you see a comparably small but impressive-looking hammer of gold and black that is currently chained to the platform. It's the one that isn't currently dangling off the side. It's in its hand and it's resting there. And you can see the heat emanating from both the pools of molten rocks on the side of it and the flames behind. Most of the imagery is perpetually shifting and being altered by the sheer volume of heat that this chamber holds. This is apparently the Core Anvil, and whatever decor around it looks very intimidating. What do you want to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h16m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="03:48:59" id="l3h48m59s">You understand, based on the discussion you guys had between the design, the platinum has to be smelted down into workable bars, ingots of metal that can be hammered and folded.

<dd data-ts="03:48:59" id="l3h48m59s">This is the forging chamber. The other doors are still closed. Once they're made into bars, and this is from the design that you recall Ioun gave you, the beads of divinity that you've been given, you have to actually shatter across the anvil and then fold the pieces into the metal. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=3h48m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="03:49:45" id="l3h49m45s">Once that's done then you actually have a solid blank of platinum inlaid with the fragments of divinity. You then have to draw out the trammel tips, which makes them into a fine point like a long javelin-like rod. Then you have to use the vise, after heating the metal, to twist the trammels. The actual design has them twisted because it helps conduct the divine energy to the point. And then using the chiseling tools, you have to work in the runes that match and channel the incantation that Scanlan's book has. It's a multi-process step that's going to require both of you to work together on this, since some elements of it are blacksmithing elements, some of it are tinkering. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=3h49m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Hammer and fold, then go and take it off to the side to two of the coal areas, and you watch as the furnaces burn and heat the metal up again. You bring it back up to the steps and hammer and fold, hammer and fold with more of it until eventually, you've managed to hammer in over the next 20 or so minutes, both of you sweating, feeling a little bit of stiffness and soreness in your arms from this process, but you've been far worse. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h1m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You grab some of the chiseling implements, and the two of you together begin to work. And you're mainly there taking the hammer and driving the back of the chisel while he's guiding the design because you don't know what vision he has. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h15m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

But you have all the intricate designs in the head that Ioun imparted with you. So now you almost go into a trance with the chiseling tools and you have three in your hands and you're juggling them behind and you're staring ahead. It's really weird to watch Percival go from this focused individual to staring off into space and his hands take over and begins moving the chisels along. Each one of them almost too fast for you to keep up and you get to the point where you're like (rapid hammering). <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h15m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
