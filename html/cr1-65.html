<dd data-ts="00:00:10" id="l0h0m10s">Welcome. Happy to be back. Very emotional episode last week. We're going to kick it into the next step of Vox Machina's adventure this week, and then, me, Marisha, and Taliesin will be gone next week, so there will not be progression in this current storyline. However, Liam O'Brien over there has been cracking up an awesome one-shot adventure for our remaining players and a few guests. Liam, if you want to talk a little about it? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You give Loot Crates to everyone in your family. That's four Loot Crates; that's $12. That is 25 and half Forever stamps that you've just gotten for free. For free! Let's say you're more generous than that. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your whole company. All 266 employees. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h1m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Go look for it right now, and it will be yours for free, essentially, if you buy 266 subscriptions to Loot Crate. 266.67. Okay, that is <i>hardcore facts.</i> You can't argue with that. Go out.

They recently announced and put up the English cast video for Final Fantasy XV. I have the pleasure of playing Cor Leonis. It's a lot of fun. As a longtime Final Fantasy fan, being a part of this means a great deal, and I'm excited for the game that comes out in November. So if you haven't checked out the video, do so and you can watch me wax poetic briefly about my love of the series.

<dd data-ts="00:08:26" id="l0h8m26s">Hello, and welcome back. So to get you guys caught up: our band of adventurers, Vox Machina, in raising an army, hopefully, of allies and powerful artifacts to face the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of powerful, dangerous chromatic dragons that have been tearing through the countryside of Tal'Dorei and distant Wildemount. They have recently found some information, had a close call with the Frigid Doom known as Vorugal. The white dragon flyover did not pierce through the illusionary barrier that was placed with the help of Allura, Gilmore, and Pike, there in Whitestone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:08:26" id="l0h8m26s">You then decided to go ahead and using that cue, before the dragon returned to its current roost that it has created over the ruins of the city of Draconia, you traveled across to the continent of Wildemount. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:08:26" id="l0h8m26s">You had a meeting with the Ravenites, a rather subverted, long-enslaved offshoot species of dragonborn kin, tailless and now surviving amongst a recent winter that seems to have come with the ruin the dragon brought. You also discovered that most of Draconia and its royal elite have been slaughtered as a means of the dragon establishing its dominance and the worship of the Ravenites that survived the fall of Draconia. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="00:08:26" id="l0h8m26s">You made a deal with Tooma, the current clan leader of the remaining Ravenites, that you would aid in destroying this dragon, basically the master that they replaced the Draconians with when it came. However, to ensure your help there was a two-week time limit, and if you do not return before then they would see you as not keeping your end of the deal, and they would then, instead, direct the dragon towards what was going to be Whitestone until you altered her memory, which she recalls now as Emon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The party had a fateful farewell; set him to rest within the ruins of the nearby library, fallen from the islands of Draconia; said your goodbyes; and then, upon prepping a bit, plotting, and planning, found your way back to Whitestone to continue the next leg of your adventure. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Anyway, my point is: for the longest time, I was terrified that I was going to lose you. First to death and then to the Raven Queen, which is still kind of like death, and then ultimately to yourself. And then I had an interesting talk with Pike recently, and she said something that really stood out to me, and that was that some people just have more of themselves to give. And I realized this whole time that I was afraid of losing you to a future that ultimately has not yet been written, which is stupid. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The other hand he reaches back into a small pouch on his side and pulls out a small amount of shimmering, glassy sand material you recognize as a hint of residuum processed into its dust crystallized form. He scatters it around while he's muttering under his breath. As he does, with his hand in the center, you see the dust pull together into these small symbols on their own, almost like magnets to iron filings. They're forming into these rigid structures. As they do, they begin to flare up and glow, and he takes a step back, his eyes still closed, brings his fist together into a grip. As he does, they light up, and you recognize this as a teleportation circle. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=1h17m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Glancing out as soon as you push out, the light is very bright, and you have to take a moment for your eyes to adjust. Looking out, you see a simple street. There are some small buildings built of fine wood; nothing too extravagant. You can see a number of trees that protrude from the sand: long, tall, thin, palm frond-type tops to them, bearing some sort of large nut-like fruit. You can see what look to be small troughs of gathered water, whether it be from rain or them placed there intentionally, but they're currently locked with some semi-translucent top and chained shut, on the outside of two of the buildings.

<dd data-ts="02:24:54" id="l2h24m54s">All right. As you guys continue deeper into the city, the sheer size of this town reminds you of a mirror universe form of Emon, in the way that the streets narrow and then open, and the liveliness of culture around you in its heyday, and it saddens you, because it reminds you of back when the city was at its prime, when you first arrived and made it a home for yourself. But at the same time, the energy is infectious, and you can't help but feel like there's a lot of interesting people, culture, and momentum all about you no matter where you seem to walk across these streets. Though the culture here appears to be far older than that of Emon that you've encountered; even the buildings and constructs range in ways that-- maybe not as old as Vasselheim, per se, but at least you can see that there's some variation to some of the abodes here that have been worn through time more so than any you have encountered in Tal'Dorei, for the most part. These decorated and intricate buildings fill the streets. You can see pride in their construction, and the smells of horses and hot desert air combine with various burning spice and sage that occasionally wafts through the air to your nostrils. The ever-changing exotic skyline occasionally grabs your attention. You see the distant shadow of what looks like a skyship docked at a sky port. You get looks of many citizens, expressions ranging from amusement to mistrust as you pass by, until you come upon a massive building that shines with the sunlight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h24m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="02:24:54" id="l2h24m54s">Above you, you see a number of red flags that hang and drift, about five feet in length, these thin, draping pieces of silk that shift with the breeze, and you can see numbers of these strands across different roads, and it's at this point that you look up and realize that this is the entrance to the Suncut Bazaar. Looking off towards the left, and what you've been watching as you approach, there are this cluster of dark blue and purple towers of various widths marking a central place in the center of the city. In the center of them, there is one very large, cylindrical tower that rises up past them all into what looks like a chalice or a cup-like platform at the very top that is impossibly high amongst the rest of the structures here in the city. It seems to be a beacon or watchtower over the entirety of Ank'Harel. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h24m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="02:24:54" id="l2h24m54s">But your attention now, here in the Suncut Bazaar, as you step around the corner, you can see tents and storefronts and buildings and voices raised as different barkers are shouting out for their wares. You can see carts being drawn through the streets by horse and camel. You can see what appear to be dozens upon dozens of people coming through with small satchels and coming by and purchasing their necessities for the day. You can smell cooking meats and food in the distance. You can see street performers juggling, and distant music of buskers in the side of the street, playing various flutes and instruments: some you recognize, some you do not. You actually see a shawm. It catches your attention on the side of the street. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h24m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Not an elf has caught your eye since you've wandered through. You've seen a couple of tieflings that walk openly in this city, which is a rare thing from Emon. Even there, most tieflings generally are met with mistrust and prejudice in the street. Here, no one seems to pay mind or bother. You do see a few half-orcs, this team of half-orcs that are shouting out in a language that none of you understand. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h28m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd data-ts="03:55:31" id="l3h55m31s">So you guys are making your way towards the Cerulean Palace. As you approach the large, extremely imposing palace, you come upon what looks to be an endless series of stairs that brings you to the upper platform that is the central portion of the city where the palace seems to reside, eventually peaking in the Sandherald district that you were referred to earlier as the location of the palace and where the Bowl of Judgment exists. You step up to the very top of the stairs to find yourself already breathless at the sight of the immense purple-blue-colored palace. A dozen towers reach for the clouds, the daylight peeking through their slightly translucent material, like glassy waters ever-frozen in a fall. The central tower, the one that caught your eye, that ends in a large cup-like position, rises above all of them with a slight spiral-type texture to the outside of the palace that is incredibly tall amongst the rest of the cityscape. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="03:55:31" id="l3h55m31s">As you get closer, you can see the main palace structure presents hundreds of arches pointed at their apex in its structure, smaller and smaller as it recesses further into the palace. Its very architectural build is a marvel, and seems to both have consistency and a chaotic feel to the placement of some of these arches too, in size. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="03:55:31" id="l3h55m31s">It's a very strange but fascinating structure. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="03:55:31" id="l3h55m31s">You can also see turquoise detailing and trim against many of the pillars and carvings and statues that adorn the exterior of the grounds of this palace. As you approach what appear to be the front gates that ascend, with a very bright blue turquoise exterior, close to 50 Hands of Ord patrol various elements of the grounds around it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="03:55:31" id="l3h55m31s">It looks like there are actual pockets of grass and gardens that exist around the Cerulean Palace in here. The topography changes almost to feel like it belongs entirely anywhere but the middle of the desert. The guards do eye you suspiciously as you approach, and you watch as one armored woman, her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an ornate helmet of brass and blue, approaches you guys. "Welcome to the Cerulean Palace. I must ask your business here." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

She turns around, her armor clinking, and walks back to the palace, leaving you guys there amongst these courtyard grounds. A few moments pass before she returns, the doors opening. As she descends, next to her you see an older woman with these long, ceremonial robes that drag behind her, spilling across the stairs as she descends, seemingly dozens of gemmed bracelets that jingle as she walks with each step. She wears a tall headdress with what looks like brass quills that press behind her head and down her back. As she approaches you all, the woman earlier that you spoke to, the Hand that approached you, stays behind quietly and watches, weapon at the ready. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h59m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you're led up the stairway, choosing right or left, they both lead to the upper platform in what is the top of the central tower of the Cerulean Palace. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="04:07:28" id="l4h7m28s">As you enter this room, you see close to a hundred dangling silk tapestries from 50 or 60 feet up of multitudes of different colors; rainbowscapes of beautiful translucent cloths and silks, gently flowing with breezes and mingling and mixing into each other around the outside of the wall. High arched windows on each side, and behind, what looks to be a large opening reveals passing clouds surrounding this height and obfuscating certain portions as they meet with the height of this tower's apex. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="04:07:28" id="l4h7m28s">You see a large balcony from the opposite side of the room that is opened from its own similar-sized arch that extends outward. It has a railing about four feet up that is an opening that overlooks in open air all above the city to see. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="04:07:28" id="l4h7m28s">In the center of the chamber, you see a series of step-like platforms, circular, that rise up upon each other, and in the center, you see what seems to be a tall throne of bronze and sapphire that probably sits ten feet up from the base. Thin, but extremely long and widens towards the top. You can see hundreds of sapphires put into and set into this shiny, ruddy metallic material that frames the entirety of the throne. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="04:07:28" id="l4h7m28s">And there sitting atop this throne, you see a slender, human-like entity wearing no jewelry, no ceremonial adornments, no crown, just a simple brown cotton shirt over simple, elegant pants. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="04:07:28" id="l4h7m28s">Bare feet, no shoes. Androgynous and beautiful; you're unable to make out the sex of this creature. It's not a man, nor elf. Not fey, but something somewhat alien, almost. The skin a deep-set reddish brown, smooth and impeccable. The features are extremely fine and delicate. The eyes are what catch you: black like night, but the pupils, burning points of molten metal. The entity smiles and stands off the throne. Now, at this height, seeing it standing almost as tall as Grog, by comparison. The limbs are elongated. Extends a hand towards you as you step into the chamber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd data-ts="04:07:28" id="l4h7m28s">"Welcome to Ank'Harel, heroes of Tal'Dorei. I am J'mon Sa Ord, and it is my pleasure to greet you." And that is where we'll pick up our session in two weeks. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
